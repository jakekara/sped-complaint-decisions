F INAL DECISION AND ORDER
SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public
education (FAPE) as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20
U.S.C. §1401 et seq, and Connecticut General Statute §10—76a. At a PPT meeting, the Parents requested
placement of the Student at Foundation School. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On August 9, 201 1 a hearing ofﬁcer was appointed, and a pre—hearing conference was held on August
25, 201 1. A hearing date of October 17, 201 1 was chosen by the parties. The parties decided to mediate
the matter rather than attend a resolution meeting. On 01‘ about October 12, 201 1, the Parents’ attorney
requested that the matter be withdrawn since the parties had resolved the matter in mediation and were
in the process of preparing an agreement.

The Board requested a withdrawal without prejudice. The request was granted. The date for the mailing

of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the mediation and the hearing dates. The
date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order is October 23, 2011.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school distn'ct responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing officer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board ofEducation shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4~183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
