The Student has been identiﬁed with Speech 01' Language Impairment and is entitled to receive FAPE as
deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq.

2015, signed a letter stating he was giving permission to his mother to proceed in his place and to
represent him in all hearings and meetings related to this matter. (Hearing Ofﬁcer’s Exhibit No. 4) At a
planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the graduation of the Student. The
Student requested to continue at the Board’s school. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

had been resolved at the resolution meeting and they were waiting for the Student to sign the agreement.

the pre-hearing conference the mother agreed to sign the agreement. The Student and Parents signed the

presented (Board Exhibit No. 2), which was the agreement signed by the Board, the Student and both his
Parents. The agreement was received as an exhibit not for its content, but to show that an agreement had

been reached and ratiﬁed by the parties. Since neither the Parent nor the Student appeared at the
