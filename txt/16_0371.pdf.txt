The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the
Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and
Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the
Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year and requested
reimbursement for the cost of the unilateral placement of the Student at Ben Bronz Academy for the
2015—2016 school year. The Board refused the Parents’ request. On February 24, 2016, the Board
received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on
February 24, 2016 and a pre—hearing conference was held on March 3, 2016. The parties agreed to
forego a resolution meeting and mediate the matter. The mediation date was pending. A hearing date of
May 19, 2016 was chosen by the parties.
