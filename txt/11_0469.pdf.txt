appointed on May 25, 201 1, and the date for mailing the decision was July 30, 2011.
The original pre-hearing conference was scheduled for June 7, 2011, but was postponed
pending the Hearing Ofﬁcer’s consideration of the Board’s Motions to Dismiss and to
Consolidate. The Hearing Ofﬁcer then dismissed some of the Parent’s issues because
they were beyond the scope of the Hearing Ofﬁcer’s authority. The Motion to
Consolidate proposed consolidation of cases involving the Student’s siblings, which was
denied.

September 8, 201 1 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0469

On June 30, 201 1, the Board requested a hearing to override Parent’s refusal to consent to
an evaluation. The Hearing Ofﬁcer consented to consolidation of the Board’s issue with
the Parent’s issues. A pre-hearing conference was held on July 19, 201 1. The hearing
for the consolidated cases was scheduled for September 6 and 9, 201 1. The decision date
was September 12, 201 1.

By letter dated J uly 28, 201 1, Parent’s Attorney requested an “indeﬁnite continuance” of
the consolidated cases, due to injuries he had received in an automobile accident, or a
thilty day continuance if a date certain was required. The Hearing Ofﬁcer responded by
re—scheduling the hearing for September 29, 201 1 and extending the decision date to
October 12, 201 1. By email dated September 1, 201 1, Parent withdrew her request for a
hearing, noting that she would re—ﬁle when her attorney was able to resume work after
surgery.

A11 motions and objections not previousiy ruled upon, if any, are hereby overruled.

of his special education program and the qualiﬁcations of school staff members assigned

members and other witnesses in place of names and other personally identiﬁable
