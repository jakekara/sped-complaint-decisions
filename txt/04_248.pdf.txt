August 24, 2004 -1- Final Decision and Order 04-248           STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION   Student v. New Britain Board of Education   Appearing on Behalf of the Student:        Student, Pro Se    Appearing on Behalf of the Board:          Attorney Lawrence J. Campane 
          Sullivan, Schoen, Campane & Connon, LLC 
          646 Prospect Avenue 
          Hartford, CT  06105 
 Appearing before:          Attorney Gail K. Mangs, Hearing Officer 
        FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The Student&#8482;s date of birth is December 9, 1974.  The Student requested this hearing on 
her own behalf on July 27, 2004.  In the request for hearing, the Student alleged acts by a teacher that, if proved true, would be evidence of that teacher having treated the Student in an unfair and prejudicial way but did not involve issues of special education.  These 
alleged events occurred between 1989 and 1992.  The prehearing conference was convened on August 20, 2004.  During the prehearing conference, the Student confirmed 
that her request for hearing did not involve any special education issues nor was she 
seeking the kind of relief that would fall within the jurisdiction of a due process hearing officer.  The jurisdiction of a due process hearing officer is confined to matters 

concerning special education (Connecticut General Statutes Section 10-76h(d)(1)).  The 
Student was advised of alternate forums in which to pursue her claims. 
  Final Decision and Order:  This hearing is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
