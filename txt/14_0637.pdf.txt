At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rej ected the exiting of the Student from
special education. The Parents requested compensatory education for the denial of FAPE. The Board
refused the Parents’ request. On June 27, 2014, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due
process. The parties agreed to forgo a resolution meeting and mediate the matter. The mediation date
was November 20, 2014. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on June 30, 2014 and a pre-
hearing conference was held on July 9, 2014. A hearing date of September 26, 2014 was chosen by the
parties.

In an electronic transmission, the parties requested that the hearing ofﬁcer cancel the September 26,
2014 hearing date in order to accommodate the mediation date. The request to cancel the hearing date
was granted and January 16, 2015 was set as the new hearing date.

In an electronic transmission, the panties informed the hearing ofﬁcer that the mediation was not
successful. In an electronic transmission dated J anuary 7, 2015 the Parents’ attorney withdrew the matter

without prejudice. There was no objection ﬁled by the Board.

The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the mediation
and the hearing date. The date for mailing the F inal Decision and Order is J anual‘y 19, 2015.
