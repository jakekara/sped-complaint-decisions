SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
: The Student is 18 years and 11 months old, has been iden
tified as Learning Disabled and is entitled to 
receive a free and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and 
Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. The Parents filed for due process after the Board rejected their position that the Student was not ready to exit special education and that the testing relied upon to make that
 decision was over a year old. On or about June 10, 2009, the Board received notice of the Parents&#8482; request for due process. A 
resolution meeting was held on or about June 24, 
2009. An impartial hearing officer was appointed on 
June 17, 2009 and a pre-hearing conference was held on June 25, 2009. At the prehearing conference the Parents informed the hearing officer that the matter 
seemed resolved at the re
solution meeting. However, 
in a letter from the Parents, the hearing officer was inform
ed that there were still issues that needed to be resolved and the matter should to go 
forward if what had been decided at the resolution meeting did not 
occur. The parties did not contact the hearing officer as to the status of the ma
tter and the hearing officer sent the parties notice of a September 24, 2009 
hearing date. On September 16, 2009 the Board 
requested that the date be cancelled due to another commitment. On or about September 22, 2009 the 
Board filed a Motion to Dismiss alle
ging that 1) the Parents have failed to state a claim over which the hearing officer has jurisdiction and/or upon which relief might be gran
ted, 2) had failed to prosecute their complaint and 3) the Student is over the age 
of 18 and parental right had transferred to him. 
On or about October 1, 2009, a letter was e-mailed to the Parents a
dvising them of the Board&#8482;s motion 
and the Parents&#8482; need to respond. The Parents did not respond to the Motion to Dismiss and on October 
23, 2009 a letter was sent to the Parents giving them until November 2, 2009 to respond to the Board&#8482;s 

motion or the matter would be dismissed. On Octobe
r 30, 2009, the Parents advised the hearing officer that they were looking for an attorney to represent them. On November 2, 2009, the Parents responded 
to the Board&#8482;s Motion to dismiss, 26 business da
ys after the Board had filed their motion and 20 
business days after the hearing officer had first inquired about any objection to the Motion to Dismiss.
