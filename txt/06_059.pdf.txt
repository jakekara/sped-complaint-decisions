(SDE) on March 1, 2006.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on March 2.  On March 7, the Board's attorney filed an a
ppearance and a response to the due process complaint, including challenges to the suffici
ency of the complaint and the Parents' 
standing to represent the Student who is over the age of 21.  The Board received the due 
process request on March 1, 2006. On March 10, the Parents' attorney filed a response to 

the Board's attorney's letter.  She stated that she represented the Student as well as the 
Parents.  She also outlined the dispute as to the Student's exiting from special education 
in June 2005.  On March 14, the Hearing Officer ruled that the complaint, as amended by 

the Student's attorney on March 10, was suffici
ent to meet the notice requirements for a 
hearing.  A prehearing conference was scheduled for March 16.  The prehearing was held 
on March 17 at which time the parties agreed 
to mediate the matter and jointly requested 
a 30-day postponement of the May 15 decision 
deadline.  A hearing date was scheduled for May 10 and the decision deadline was extended to June 14, 2006.  On April 7, the Student's attorney wrot
e to the Hearing Officer requesting a postponement of the May 10 hearing in order to
 continue the mediation on that date.  On 
April 24, the Board's attorney wrote to the Hearing Officer requesting that the hearing 

date be postponed to May 23 by agreement of the parties.  On April 28, the Hearing 

Officer granted the postponement of the May 
10 hearing to May 23 and reset the decision deadline to June 16, 2006.  On May 11 the SDE advised the Hearing Officer that the parties reached agreement on May 10 and that
 the hearing request was withdrawn with prejudice.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  It is ordered that this case be dismissed with prejudice.
