FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

Issues:

1. Does the hearing ofﬁcer lack jurisdiction to hear Parent’s request for a due process hearing
because the child in question is receiving Section 504 services, and not Special Education
services?

2. Does the hearing ofﬁcer have j urisdiction because the student should have been identiﬁed as a
special education student and thus is entitled to protections under IDEA‘,>

Procedural Histmy:

Parent mailed a request for a due process hearing on January 12, 2012. The request was
received by the Connecticut State Department 01‘ Education (hereinafter, “CSDE”) on January
17, 2012. The Torrington Board ofEducation (hereinafter "Board”) received Parent’s request
the following day, January 18, 2012. On January 18, 2012, the CSDE assigned the case to a
hearing of t1ce1‘ for an expedited hearing. A preheating conference was held on January 23, 2012,
during which the Board’s attorney raised the issue ofwhether the hearing ofﬁcer had jurisdiction
to conduct a hearing, because the student was not a special education student, as suggested by
terms used in the Parent’s hearing request, but rather a student identiﬁed as eligible for and
receiving services under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. During the conference, Parent’s
counsel stated his intent to ﬁle an Amended Request for Hearing and the Board’s Attorney stated
her intent to ﬁle a Motion to Dismiss A hearing date on the Motion to Dismiss was set for
January 31, 2012. A hearing date on the substance of the request was scheduled for February 10,
2012 to ensure compliance with the deadlines for expedited hearings set out in 34 C.F.R §
300.532 (c)(2).

February 3, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0251

Parent’s Attorney ﬁled an amended request for hearing on January 23, 2012. A second
preheating conference was held on January 27, 2012 to discuss deadlines for ﬁling of the
Board’s Motion to Dismiss and Parent’s Objection to same. Per agreement of counsel, at the
second prehearing conference the Board ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum of Law in
Support of The Board’s Motion to Dismiss on January 27, 2012 and Parent‘s attorney ﬁled a
Memorandum in Opposition to School Board’s Motion to Dismiss on January 30, 2012. A
hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held on January 31, 2012 on the Motion to Dismiss,
during which counsel presented oral argument.

Findings of Fact:

1, Prior to February 201 1, the student had been identiﬁed as a special education student and
received services under an lEP developed and implemented by the Ton'ington Public
Schools.

21 A I’PT meeting was held on February 17, 201 1. At this meeting it was decided that the
student was no longer in need ot‘speeial education services and that the student would be
exited from Special Education on February 25, 201 1 . (Exhibit B-l, Pages 1-2: February
17, 201 l PPT Meeting Notes)

3. On the same day that the PPT met and determined that the student would he exited from
the special education program, a Section 504 team meeting was convened and the student
was identiﬁed as a student in need of services under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act. (Exhibit P—2, Pages 1—2: February 17, 2011 Section 504 Meeting Notes) Mother
attended this meeting at which an accommodation plan was developed and consented to
its implementation. 1d,

41 It is alleged that on January 5, 2012, the student brought a weapon to school, in response
to this incident, the student’s 504 team met on January 9, 2012, in order to determine
whether 01‘ not the student’s behavior was a manifestation of the student’s disability,
(Exhibit B—2, Page 1—2: Manifestation Determination Report) At that meeting the 504
team found that the behavior was neither a manifestation of the child’s disability, nor was
it the result of the school’s failure to properly implement the 504 accommodation plan.
Id. Mother disagreed with the ﬁnding of the 504 team and her disagreement was
recorded by the team. 1d. An expulsion hearing was set for January 20, 2012, but has
been postponed pending a resolution of Parent’s due process hearing request.

Conclusions of Law:
Hearing Ofﬁcer Lacks Jurisdiction to Hear Parent’s Complaint dated January 12, 2012

1, This hearing ofﬁcer lacks jurisdiction to hear the Parent’s complaint dated January
12, 2012, Section 10~76h, Connecticut General Statutes (06.8.), and related
regulations at Section 10-7611, Regulations ol‘Connecticut State Agencies, authorize
an impaltial hearing ofﬁcer to conduct a hearing on special education issues.
Connecticut law provides that while a special education hearing ofﬁcer has the

February 3, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0251

authority to hear and decide Section 504 claims, he may do so only as necessary to
resolve claims under IDEA. (Mark McQuillan, Circular Letter: C-13, Series 2008—09
Reissue) If the only issues before the special education hearing ofﬁcer allege
violations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the special education hearing
officer does not have authority and redress must be sought through the available
Section 504 due process procedures. In re: Student with a disability, 102 LRP 20082
(SEA CT 2001).

2. The substantive issue raised by Parent in the January 12, 2012 complaint is whether
the Section 504 team erred when it determined that the conduct that gave rise to the
disciplinaiy action was not a manifestation of student’s disability on January 9, 2012.
Student is entitled to a review of this substantive claim under the due process
procedures for Section 504, under 34 CFR § 10436, because the student is
identiﬁed under Section 504 with a Section 504 Accommodation Plan. and the
manifestation determination at issue was made by student’s Section 504 team. (See
Exhibits B—2, P—2)

3. The IDEA does not provide authority for a special education hearing ofﬁcer to
review the manifestation determination of a student’s Section 504 team, unless the
student can assert they are eligible for protection under 34 C.F.R. § 300.534
protections for children not determined eligible for special education and related
serv1ces.

4. The IDEA protections afforded to special education students subject to discipline are
not applicable in the present case, where at the time 0f1he incident the student had
been evaluated, deemed ineligible for special education services and formally exited
from the school’s special education program; he was eligible only for Section 504
services. Under IDEA, where there is a claim that a manifestation determination by a
student’s PPT was in error, that determination may be appealed and heard in an
expedited manner by a special education hearing ofﬁcer. 34 CPR t § 503.33. Under
the facts of the present case, no such appeal can be taken because at the time of the
incident the student had been formally exited from his special education program (see
Exhibit 13-2) and transitioned to a 504 Team and accommodation plan (February 17.
201 1). No manifestation determination was conducted by a PPT, and thus no appeal
under this section can be taken.

5. Parent claims that her references to a PPT and IEP in the January 12, 2012 complaint
amount to a claim for reliefunder IDEA. It is clear that Parent was mistaken in the
use of such terms. In the J anuary 12, 2012 complaint Parent stated the “. . .PPT (held
1/ 12/ 12) decided that my child’s behavior was not a manifestation of his disability.”
The record reﬂects the manifestation determination was conducted not a PPT but a
504 team meeting. The Manifestation Determination Repon — Section 504 generated
by the 504 team was signed by Parent. (Manifestation Determination Report »
Section 4, Exhibit B~1)

February 3, 2012 Finat Decision and Order 12-0251

6. While Parent states in her request that she believes the school should change her
“child’s IEP", rather than expel him”, the exhibits show that on the same day Parent
sent her initial complaint, she participated in the Section 504 Team annual review of
the student’s program where changes to the child‘s program were discussed and
agreed upon pending the outcome 01‘ the anticipated expulsion hearing. (Exhibit B—2
Page 3)

7. The IDEA protections for children not determined eligible for special education are
not applicable to student. Under subsection (a) 0134 C.F.R. § 300.534, a student may
avail himself of the protections and procedures under 34 C.F.R. § 300.530-532 upon
a demonstration that the school board had knowledge that the child was a child with a
disability, provided such knowledge existed before the behavior that precipitated the
disciplinary action occurred. Under subsection (b) of34 C.F.R. § 300.534, the
schooi board is deemed to have knowledge of the disability if one ofthe following
actions can be shown:

1) The parent of the child expressed concern in writing to supervismy or
administrative personnel of the appropriate educational agency, or a teacher of the
child, that the child is in need of special education and related services;

(2) The parent of the child requested an evaluation of the child pursuant to
§§300t300 through 300,311; or

(3) The teacher ofthe child, or other personnel of the LEA, expressed speciﬁc
concerns about a pattern of behavior demonstrated by the child directly to the
director ofspecial education ol‘the agency or to other supervisory personnel of
the agency.

8. Parent claims that the student is entitled to assert IDEA protections because Parent
expressed concern in writing that the child was in need of special education services
In suppoﬁ, Parent points to a hand written note next to Section 8 of the February 17,
201 1 Section 504 meetng notes which reads: “Mom was concerned about him falling
through the cracks now that he’s not receiving special education services.
Accommodations were discussed to ensure this wouldn’t happen” As this note was
written by a member ofthe Section 504 team, it cannot be considered a formal written
notiﬁcation by Parent. The note documents a discussion ot‘coneerns between the
Parent and 504 team members regarding the transition of the student to the Section
504 accommodation plan. At the end of this Section 504 team meeting, the Parent
signed the accommodation plan giving her written consent to the implementation of
this program. (Exhibit P—2). No appeal of the student’s accommodation plan was
taken and no other writing was produced in support of Parent’s claim that Parent
submitted a written request for special education services.

9. Parent does not claim that she requested an evaluation of the child pursuant to Section
§§300.300 through 300.31 and no documentation of such a request was submitted.

2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0251

Parent also claims but fails to demonstrate that teachers or other personnel of the
LEA expressed speciﬁc concerns about a pattern of students behavior before the
behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred. While the statements of
teachers provided by Parent include concerns about the student, these statements were
generated and submitted for the 504 manifestation determination which occurred after
the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred, and not before as
required under 34 CFR § 300,534 (a).

. Further, the Board’s actions qualify it for the exception set out in 34 C.F.Rt

§300.534(c) which states that a school board will not be deemed to have knowledge,
where a school board has evaluated the child in accordance with 34 C.FR.
§§300.300 through 300.31 1 and determined the student not to be a child with a
disability Per the student‘s February 17, 201 l PPT meeting notes, the student was
evaluated, a PPT meeting was held and the PPT determined that the student was no
longer eligible for special education services. (February 17, 2011 PPT hearing notes,
Exhibit B—l) Therefore the Board cannot be deemed to have knowledge of
disabilities that would give rise to protections for student otherwise available under
34 C.FR. §300.354 (a) and (b).

No Decision Reached on Amended Complaint dated January 13, 2012

The parties agreed to an expedited hearing. The scope of expedited hearings are
limited. 34 C.F.R. §300.532(c) and RCSA §10—76h—10. The hearing ofﬁcer
acknowledges receipt of Parent’s Amended Complaint, dated January 23, 2012.

Upon review ofthe substance of the amended complaint, the hearing ofﬁcer has
determined that the issues raised in the amended complaint do not fall under the
categories for which an expedited hearing is permissible, Id. This decision is therefore
conﬁned to the issues presented in Parent’s original request for a due process hearing,
which was dated January 12, 2012. The hearing offer explicitly reaches no decision
regarding the merits of the claims made in Parent’s amended complaint Should
Parent choose to do so she may request a new due process hearing on the issues raised
in her amended complaint. 1d.

Final Decision and Order:

The Board’s Motion to Dismiss Parent’s Request for a Hearing dated January 12,
2012 is granted, Accordingly, this case is dismissed.
