Did the Board offer an appropriate program for the 2002-2003 school year?  2.  If not, does Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center offer an appropriate program?  3.  Does the student require residential placement for educational purposes?  PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:  This hearing was requested on July 12, 2002.  The prehearing conference was held on July 17, 2002 at which time the parties agreed to notify the hearing officer of their availability for hearing.  When the parties failed to notify the hearing officer of proposed dates, the hearing was arbitrarily set for September 4, 2002.  The hearing convened on September 4;  the parties entered into negotiations and, after several hours, notified the hearing officer that they had agreed to a settlement.  They requested two weeks to prepare and execute a written agreement.  It was agreed that the parents would notify the hearing officer on or before September 18 of the finalized agreement and a withdrawal of their hearing request; if such notification did not occur, the hearing would be dismissed.  On September 17, the parents requested additional time to finalize the agreement.  The hearing officer extended the date to the close of business on September 20, 2002, on or before which the parties were to notify the hearing officer of the final disposition of the case or the matter would be dismissed.  As of the close of business on September 20, 2002, no response from either party was received by the hearing officer.
