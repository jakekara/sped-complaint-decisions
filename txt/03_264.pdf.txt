Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  1) Should the Student undergo a psychiatric evaluation by a psychiatrist of the Board&#8482;s choosing?

education program and psychiatric evaluation and would never let his son participate in a 
special education program. 
 The hearing convened on September 11, 2003.  Neither the parents nor the Student 
appeared at the hearing.  The Board&#8482;s attorney left a voicemail message for the father at 
his work number, and Ms. Frances Haag, Senior
 Coordinator for Special Education, left a message for the parents regarding the hearing.  Neither parent appeared at the hearing.

September 11, 2003 hearing in order for the family to request another hearing date in the
