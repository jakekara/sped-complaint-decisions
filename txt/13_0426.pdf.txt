CONCLUSIONS OF LAW and ARGUMENT:

l.

4.

It is undisputed that the Student is eligible for special education and related services as
set f01th in IDEA, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401, et seq. FAPE is deﬁned as special education and
related services that are provided at public expense, meet the standards of the state
educational agency, include an appropriate school education, and that are provided in
conformity with the IEP 20 U.S.C. §l401(8).

IDEA requires that the parties to a due process hearing hold a resolution meeting,
“[w]ithin 15 days 01‘1‘eceiving notice of the due process complaint, and prior to the
initiation of the due process hearing” 34 C.F.R. §300,510(a)(1)

The meeting gives the Board an oppottunity to ascertain the facts that are the basis for the
Parent’s ﬁling the complaint and conduct a discussion to see if the matter can be resolved
quickly and reduce the cost of a due process hearing. 34 C .F.R. §300.510(a)(2)

IDEA also provides safeguards to ensure that the resolution process is followed:

a, If an LEA is unable to obtain the palticipation 0f the [P]arent in the resolution
meeting after reasonable efforts have been made, and documented (using the
procedures in §300.322(d)), the LEA may, at the conclusion of the 30~day
resolution period, request that a hearing ofﬁcer dismiss the [Pjarent’s due process
complaint. 34 C.F.R. §300.510(b)(3)t

b. If the LEA fails to hold the resolution meeting within 15 days of receiving notice
ot‘a [P]ai'ent’s due process complaint or fails to participate in the resolution
meeting, the [P]a1‘ent may seek the intervention ofa hearing ofﬁcer to begin the
due process hearing timelines. 34 C.F.Rt §300.510(b)(4).

5. The Board complied with IDEA and made reasonable efforts to attempt to provide a
resolution meeting in order to ascertain the issues and see if the matter could be resolved.
(Findings ofFact Nos 3, 4 and 6)

6. After the thiﬁy (30) day resolution period, the Board ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss based on
the Parent’s failure to participate in the resolution meeting. The Parent did not ﬁle an
objection and at the hearing on June 18, 2013, the Parent failed to appear and did not
provide a reason for not appearing or failing to respond to the Board’s attempt to conduct
a resolution meeting.

7. The Motion to Dismiss was taken on the papers and the matter was dismissed according
to 34 CPR. §3001510(b)(3) and “failure to prosecute a hearing.” Regulations of
Connecticut State Agencies (RCSA) 10—76h(18)(a)(1).
