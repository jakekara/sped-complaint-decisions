PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The complaint was ﬁled by the Parent 0n Febmaly 9, 2015; a prehearing conference was held on
March 26, 2015. The initial due process hearing date was April 30, 2015; this was subsequently
moved to May 14, 2015, with the ﬁnal decision and order date extended to May 26, 2015. The Board
ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss on April 24, 2015; the Hearing Ofﬁcer allowed the Parents to respond to the
Motion by May 8, 2015; the Parent ﬁled an Objection to the Motion to Dismiss on May 3, 2015.

Through its motion, the Board argued that the Parent was requesting a ruling (to reimburse the Parent
for a diagnostic placement) on subject matter over which the Hearing Ofﬁcer lacked jurisdiction and
that was speciﬁcally barred by Connecticut statute; therefore, the Board argued that dismissal was
mandated. The Board fuither argued that the Parent never claimed the purpose of the unilateral
placement was for any purpose other than a diagnostic evaluation. The Parent argued that the Board
failed to make the diagnostic placement within a reasonable period of time, thus forcing the Parent to
place the Student unilaterally. The Parent provided no statutory or regulatory justiﬁcation that would
allow a Parent to unilaterally place a child for diagnostic purposes or that would override the Board’s
right to choose its own evaluator. The Board informed the Parent that the placement had not been
recommended by the Flaming and Placement Team and that the Board objected to the Parent’s chosen
placement. Through the objection to the Board’s motion, the Parent admitted that it was a diagnostic
evaluation (placement is the word used by the Parent, indicating that a diagnostic evaluation was
considered a placement by some states and couits; Conneetieut is not one of those states). Without an
argument other than one which essentially agreed with the Board’s position, the Hearing Ofﬁcer had

no basis on which to deny the Motion to Dismiss; the Motion to Dismiss was granted Without

prejudice. The Parent also ﬁled a request to Amend the Complaint; this was not addressed as the
granting of the Board’s motion ended the case.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The complaint is DISMISSED, without prejudice, as the Board’s Motion to Dismiss has been granted.
