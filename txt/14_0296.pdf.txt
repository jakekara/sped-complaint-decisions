June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296
JURISDICTION:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes (CGS) §10-
76h and related regulations, 20 United States Code§1415(t) and related regulations, and in

accordance with the Uniform Administration Procedures Act, CGS §§4—176e to 4-178, inciusive,
and 4—181a and 4-186.

SUMMARY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Emotional Disturbance and is entitled to receive FAPE as
deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401
et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq.

At a PPT meeting, the Parents stated that the program offered the Student for the 2013-2014
school year was not appropriate and requested reimbursement for cost incurred for the uni1atera1
placement at J DA. The Board denied the Parents’ request and the Parents requested due process.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

On December 5, 2013, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. On
December 12, 2013, the request for due process was amended by agreement of the parties.

An impaitial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on December 5, 2013 (Hearing Ofﬁcer’s Exhibit1
No. 1) and a pre-hearing conference was held on December 12, 2013. On January 2, 2014, the
parties attended a mediation session but were not able to resolve the matter. Hearing dates of
J anuary 27, 31, and February 4, 2014 were chosen by the parties. Additional hearing dates of
February 19, March 5 and March 10, 2014 were later chosen by the parties.

The Board presented Exhibits 1 thru 44 which are full exhibits of the hearing. The Parents
presented Exhibits 1 through 23 and were accepted as full exhibits of the hearing. The Parents
presented seven witnesses and the Board presented four witnesses. The parties agreed to allow
three of the Patents’ witnesses to testify by telephone. The telephonic testimony was permitted
because the witnesses resided in another state and requiring them to appear in person would have
created an economic hardship for the Parents. The patties were provided with the procedure for
the telephonic testimony (H0. 7). Afﬁdavits were submitted as required in the procedures for
telephonic testimony. (HO. 4, 5 and 6). A rebuttal witness was called by the Parents’ attorney to
rebut speciﬁc testimony from three of the Board’s witnesses. A brieﬁng schedule was requested
by the parties and simultaneous briefs were time1y ﬁled.

This F inal Decision and Order set forth the Hearing Ofﬁcer’s summary, ﬁndings of fact and
conclusions of law. The ﬁndings of facts and conclusions of law set forth herein, which
reference certain exhibits and witness testimony, are not meant to exclude other supported
evidence in the record. All evidence presented was considered in deciding this matter. To the
extent that the summary, procedural history and ﬁndings of fact actually represent eonc1usions of
law, they should be so considered and vice versa. SAS Institute Inc. v. S, & H Computer

FINDINGS OF FACT:

1. Prior to a ﬁnding of eligibility, the Student was receiving services under Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. On September 3, 2013, the Student was diagnosed with
Emotional Disturbance and found eligible to receive special education and related
services as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act
(“IDEA”) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a (Board’s
Exhibit2 No. 3, Testimony of House Administrator ).

2. The Student was doing well academically in grammar and middle school and was placed
in an Advanced Learning Program in the eighth grade. Upon entering high school his
grades began to slip and he became overly intrigued and involved with computers. The
Student’s attendance began deteriorating during the second semester of his ninth grade

year. The Parents provided excuses for all the Student’s absences during the ninth grade.
(Testimony of Mother, B.-19)

3. The Student’s grade point average (GPA) dropped from a 3.51 in the ninth grade to 2.9 in
the tenth grade. (Testimony of School Counselor, B-19)

4. On J anuary 4, 2012, the Student’s pediatrician advised the school that the Student had
contracted mononucleosis but was able to return to school. The Student had been absent
6 days prior to the receipt of the memo allowing him to return to school. On January 10,
2012, the Student’s doctor sent a memo stating that the Student’s infection might cause
excessive absence and he would attend school as tolerated. Even though the Student was
cleared to return to school, he did not. On February 20, 2012, his pediatrician sent

another note stating that Student may return to school as tolerated. (Testimony of
Mother, B—4)

5. From January 6, 2012 to May 25, 2012 of the 2011-2012 school year, the Student was
absent 34 times. Even though the Parents called in to excuse the Student’s absences, the
absences were noted as House Administrator’s Excuse because of the doctor’s note and
to avoid having him lose credit for his classes. (Testimony of School Counselor, B-19)

6. During the Student’s 2012-2013 school year, the Student was absent 40 times because of
illness. The absences were all excused by the Parents. The counselor noted that the
absences were excessive but there was accountability with reason for the absences. Since
the absences were excused the counselor did not check to see if they were caused by
depression. The counselor was satisﬁed with the Student’s excuses for absenteeism. In

a
z Hereaﬁer Board’s Exhibits will be noted as “B” followed by the number of the exhibit.

February 2013, at the end of the second quarter of the 2012-2013 school year, the

counselor was concerned and reached out to the Parents. (Testimony of School
Counselor, B-19)

During the 2012-2013 school year, the Student, while at home, was acting isolated,
withdrawing from family and friends, and not eating or sleeping well. The Parent felt
that his infatuation with the computer was starting to confuse the Student. His school
grades were crashing and he was receiving incompletes. The Parent took the Student to a
psychologist recommended by his pediatrician. (Testimony of Mother, B-5 pg. 7)

The Parent informed the school counselor that they had met with a psychologist who felt
the Student was suffering from depression. The-Parents requested a meeting with the
Student’s school counselor. In February 2013, the school counselor met with the Parents
but did not refer the Student to special education because he did not feel it was necessary:
there was no diagnosis and he did not feel it would serve his needs. The school counselor
recommended two therapists for the Student’s emotional problems and possible
depression. (Testimony of Mother, P-S pg. 9)

The Student was evaluated by his psychiatrist on February 25 , 2013. On February 27,
2013, the Student’s psychiatrist sent a letter to the school stating the Student was
diagnosed with major depressive disorder and had been symptomatic for several months.
The doctor recommended homebound instructions for the month of March. (B-22a)

In the beginning of March, the Student was scheduled to receive 10 hours per week of
homebound instruction. At the onset the Student was doing well in homebound but
toward the middle of the month of homebound instruction, the Student became more
involved with the computer and the Parents were not able to control his use of the
computer. The Student was not attending all the sessions of homebound instruction. The
Parents did not reach out to the school; they were reaching out to the Student’s therapist
and psychiatrist. (B-25, P-5 pg.11, Testimony of Mother)

On February 27, 2013, the school received a letter from the Student’s psychiatrist stating
that the Student’s symptoms were under better control and requested 504
accommodations. On March 26, 2013, the Parent notiﬁed the Student’s counselor and
requested a child study team meeting/planning and placement meeting to address the
need for a 504 accommodation plan. (Testimony of Mother, B—5 pg. 15, P-23)

The Student had issues with his Parents and was becoming addicted to the computer. The
Parents advised the school social worker that the Student was depressed but they had
been calling him out sick and had not advised the school that he was depressed. The

Student’s psychiatrist recommended reduced class time. (Testimony of Social Worker,
P—9)

On April 1, 2013, a Section 504 Multidisciplinary team met to discuss the Student’s
eligibility under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Student was found
eligible under the disability of Depression. The accommodations to be provided to the

Student were: excused from the school attendance policy, extended time for all tests,

limited makeup work to essential assignments only, and modiﬁed tests and assignments
as needed. (B-15)

The multidisciplinary 504 team used information obtained from Parents, doctor, teachers
and staff to decide on the Student’s eligibility. There were no evaluations performed to
substantiate the Student’s eligibility, only a letter from the Student’s psychiatrist. The
team was aware of theStudent’s attendance and that he needed to return to school.
(Testimony of 504 Coordinator, B-15)

The Student attended school for ten days after the 504 plan was developed. On April 19,
2013, the Student was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. The Student had
informed a friend on the internet that he was contemplating suicide. The friend called the
police. The Student told the police that the suicidal ideations were due to his poor school
performance. (Testimony of Parent)

On April 23, 2013, the Student was discharged from the psychiatric hospital. The
treating psychiatrist stated that the Student could return to school. The student was to
participate in individual therapy and be medically managed by his psychiatrist. The

discharging physician recommended a decreased academic workload and support with his
academic assignments. (B—28)

On April 26, 2013, a PPT was convened to plan the Student’s return to the school. The
Parents requested one-on-one tutoring to support the Student. The team rej ected this
request because it was not recommended on the Student’s discharge summary and the
team did not have information to support the request. The team advised the Parent that if
a medical note was provided a 504 meeting would be convened to consider a one-on-one
tutor. The team found that the Student did not require special education and related
services. The team needed more information on his disability but no evaluations were
requested at this time. The Parents did not request nor did the Board feel evaluations
were necessary. The Student’s issues were being met and depression does not require an
evaluation. (B-l, Testimony of House Administrator)

After the April 26, 2013 PPT meeting, the Student did not return to school. The
Student’s psychiatrist requested home bound instructions with an individualized tutor for
pre—calculus. This was to continue until June 2013 to help the Student catch up on work
he had missed. (Testimony of House Administrator, B—29, B-30)

The Student stopped seeing his psychiatrist on May 20, 2013. On the advice of the
psychiatrist, the Parents unilaterally placed the Student in Second Nature, a wilderness
program in Georgia. The Parents decided to place the Student in Second Nature because
of the Student’s suicidal ideations, not attending school, poor grades and his computer
obsession. The Parents did not give 10 days’ notice to the Board of the unilateral
placement. (Testimony of Mother, B-33)

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

20. The purpose of Second Nature is to make the Student more responsible. The Master
Treatment Plan establishes goals and objectives to address the Student’s therapeutic
needs. The Student demonstrated a feeling of inadequacy because his mother managed
him and he could not function without her. In one month, the Student realized that he
contributed to the problems and learned cognitive strategies to help him deal with his
issues. (Testimony of Wilderness Therapist, B-39)

21. The discharge summary from Second Nature recommended a residential or therapeutic
placement. The discharging clinician recommended that the Student go directly into
residential placement and not go home. The Student’s diagnosis at Second Nature was

based on information obtained from the Parents and Student. (Testimony of Wilderness
Therapist)

22. At Second Nature the Student was doingindependent work for academics. There are no
licensed teachers at Second Nature. The discharging clinician recommended a small
structured setting with clear rules/boundaries and immediate natural consequences.
School accommodations and a more individualized instruction plan will be important for
his academic success. Individualized, group, and family therapy sessions were
recommended. (Testimony of Wilderness Therapist, P-Zl)

23. The Student’s residential placement at J ohn Dewey Academy (J DA) did not accept the
academic credits the Student obtained at Second Nature. Biology credits are given at
Second Nature for living outdoors and English credits for maintaining a journal. The
Student continued to be a junior based on his credits. (Testimony of Director of JDA)

24. On May 28, 2013, the Board had a PPT meeting to address the unilateral placement of the
Student at Second Nature. The PPT agreed to evaluate the Student and the parent signed
consent for evaluations. The Student was not locally available for evaluation. (B-2)

25. The Parents agreed to have the school evaluate the Student at the wilderness program.
The Board did not respond to the Parent’s emails concerning the agreed upon evaluations.

The Parents obtained their own evaluator to evaluate the Student. (Testimony of Mother,
P-13)

26. The Student was evaluated at Second Nature by Dr. Quinten Harvey. The Student was
diagnosed with Maj or Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Moderate, Anxiety Disorder, Not
Otherwise Speciﬁed, Parent—Child Relationship Problems and Identity Problems. The
Student’s depression, anxiety and school refusal escalate and have an adverse effect on
his education in that they preclude him from accessing academic curriculum within his
school setting. (Testimony of Dr. Quinten Harvey, B-33)

27. The evaluator recommended that individualized academic goals be identiﬁed to assist the
Student in recapturing his motivation to achieve academically, and therapeutic goals to
address the emotional and behavioral issues. The Student has issues with trust and self-
esteem and requires therapy to treat these issues. The Student did not mention any
difﬁculty with his teachers in the high school. The Parent—Child Relationship is a cause

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

of the Student’s depression, anxiety and school refusal. It has escalated to profound
levels and has had an adverse effect on his education. Weekly group therapy would not
be adequate for the Student. (Testimony of Dr. Quinten Harvey, B~33)

28. The Student’s computer video games obsession had escalated to an addictive quality and
had caused him to become constantly tired and unable to do his school work. The
evaluator felt that the Student needs to redirect his interest in computers. It is important
for the Student to identify areas of life affected by his video game playing. The Student

did not recall his academic decline because of his depression. (Testimony of Dr. Quinten
Harvey, B-33)

29. The evaluator was of the opinion that placing the Student in the Board’s Community
Learning Program (CLP) would place the Student with similar distressed students and

this would not be good for the Student. It also has limited higher education opportunities.
(B-33, Testimony of Dr. Quinten Harvey)

30. On July 30, 2013, the Parents gave notice that upon being exited from Second Nature,
and in the absence of an appropriate educational program for the Student, they were
unilaterally placing him at JDA. On August 9, 2013, the Student was placed at JDA.
The Parents were aware of the results of Dr. Harvey’s evaluation before they unilaterally
placed the student at J DA. (Testimony of Mother, B-32)

31. On August 8, 2013, the Student was discharged from Second Nature. On August 9, 2013
the Student entered J DA. (Testimony of Mother)

32. A PPT was scheduled for September 3, 2013 to review the Student’s placement at JDA.
The team reviewed Dr. Harvey’s evaluation and the Student’s transcripts from Second
Nature. With the information from Dr. Harvey’s report and the eligibility check list, the
PPT found the Student eligible for special education and related services under the
category of Emotional Disturbance. The PPT recommended a diagnostic placement at

J DA. The Parent signed consent for the placement. (Testimony of Mother, Testimony of
Special Education Teacher, B-3)

33. On September 24, 2013, the PPT sent the school psychologist and the special education
teacher to observe the Student at the diagnostic placement. The team reported that the
Student was observed in two classes. The Student was engaged in oral questions and
answered his teacher. He was focused and his attention was good. (B-21)

34. During the observation, the school team had an informal conversation with the Student.
He was found to be personable, articulate and comfortable with conversation. The
Student stated that the reason he needed to be at JDA was to be motivated. The Student
did not need any academic supports or tutoring. (Testimony of School Psychologist,
Testimony of Special Education Teacher)

35. On October 1, 2013, a PPT was held to review the Student’s diagnostic placement. The
PPT refused the Parents’ request for reimbursement for the Student’s placement at

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

Second Nature. The PPT was updated by the Director of J DA. The Student was
participating in class despite not having individual therapy for two of the last four weeks.
Work completion and attendance were not issues for the Student. The PPT identiﬁed
small classes, individual therapy, group therapy and community building group/work
experience as areas that needed to be incorporated in the Student’s IEP. (B-5)

The Student has six classes at JDA. The student does well academically. He is permitted
6 hours per week on the computer for an online course. The students vote on the other
students’ progress and if they should move up in rank. The highest ranking is older
membership and the privileges obtained for this rank is that the student can go home
alone and to town alone. (Testimony of Director of JDA)

The Student is still struggling with social anxiety and worries about family dynamics. At
J DA missing class is a serious issue if the Student is not sick. All students except seniors
stay during the summer. The Student uses the internet to escape. J DA does not offer any
advance placement (AP) classes. The program at J DA is to get the students to enter and
succeed in college. Individualized therapy is provided as needed and the basis is one
time per week. The Parents’ concern about the Board program is whether the program is
structured so that the Student would feel challenged and stimulated by his peers. The
main concern for the JDA director about the Board’s program would be the Student’s
after school hours. (Testimony of Director of J DA)

On October 15, 2013, a PPT was held to plan the Student’s program. Before the PPT, the
Parents were provided with a draft IEP. The Parents requested placement at J DA for the
2013—2014 school year. The Board refused the Parents’ request. The Board members of
the PPT were of the opinion that the diagnostic placement showed that the Board could
provide a program for the Student. The intent of J DA was not to return the Student to

public school, but to maintain him there until graduation. (Testimony of House
Administrator)

The Parents felt that the Student needs to remain at JDA until he completes all the levels.
This would take approximately 18 months. The Student has no internet access at J DA
except for an online course. The Parent was concerned that that the program at
ARCH/CLP was not challenging enough for the Student and he would withdraw. The
Parent did not agree with the individual and group therapy. The Parents felt the amount
of time allocated for group and individual therapy were not sufﬁcient. The Parents were
concerned that the Student would have too much free time after school and would be

more involved with his computer and would withdraw and isolate himself. (Testimony of
Mother)

At the October 15, 2013 PPT meeting, the team recommended an IEP to be implemented
at the Alternative High School’s Community Learning Program (CLP)/ARCH, an
alternative community-based program located at another site from the Board’s high
school. The program would start at 8 am and end at 1:35 pm. The Student would have
an additional 45 minutes at the end of the school day for a structured study hall. His
program would end at 2:15 pm. The Student’s day would begin in the resource room

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

with the special education teacher/aide working on goals 4 and 5. These are post-
graduation planning goals. (Testimony of CLP/ARCH School Counselor)

41. Goal number 4 in the IEP of October 15, 2013 was recommended by the Parents. The
Student did not have any behavioral problems while attending the Board’s high school.
The Student does not require extended school year services (ESY). The summer classes
he had at J DA were for credit and not to maintain level of academic performance. The
CLP/ARCH Program is a small individualized program with community support.
(Testimony of House Administrator)

42. The October 15, 2013 IEP, provided .97 hours per week of group therapy and .47 hours
per week of individual therapy. The Student’s IEP goals addressed his anxiety,
depression, avoidance and isolationism. (B—6)

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW and ARGUMENT:

1. It is undisputed that the Student is eligible for special education and related services as
set forth in IDEA, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401, et seq. FAPE is deﬁned as special education and
related services that are provided at public expense, meet the standards of the state
educational agency, include an appropriate school education, and that are provided in
conformity with the IEP. 20 U.S.C. §1401(8).

CHILD FIND

2. The Parents allege that the Board violated the child ﬁnd requirement of IDEA. Either
a parent or a public agency may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if
a student is a student with a disability. 34 CFR 300.301 (b). Additionally, the IDEA
"child ﬁnd” mandate requires that districts seek out students that are potentially IDEA
eligible and refer those students for an evaluation. 34 CFR 300.111. Since the child ﬁnd
obligation is an afﬁrmative one, a patent is not required to request that a district identify
and evaluate a child. Robertson County Sch. Sys. v. King, 24 IDELR 1036 (6th Cir.
1996). A district may not take a passive approach and wait for others to refer the student
for special education services, the district must seek out IDEA eligible students. Compton
Uniﬁed Sch. Dist. v. Addison, 54 IDELR 71 (9th Cir. 2010), cert, denied, 132 S. Ct.
996,112 LRP 13212012).

3. Excessive absenteeism by itself is not a per se basis for suspecting the child has a
disability. Board of Educ. of Sﬁvracuse City Sch. Dist., 37 IDELR 232 (SEA NY 2002).
Outcomes of cases involving child ﬁnd and truant students vary widely; a district's child
ﬁnd obligation may be triggered where there are signiﬁcant absences, a reason to believe
the absences are linked to a disability, and a need for services. In Department of
Education, State of Hawaii v. Cari Rae S., 35 IDELR 90 (D. Hawaii 2001), for example,
the court held that the student's 159 absences, numerous behavioral referrals, and failing
grades should have triggered referral during the student's sophomore year.

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

When it comes to truancy, emotional disturbance is the eligibility category that is
typically at issue. Under the IDEA implementing regulation 34 CFR 300.8 (c)(4)(i),
“emotional disturbance" means a condition exhibiting one or more of the following
characteristics "over a long period of time and to a marked degree that adversely affects a
child's educational performance":

(A) An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or
health factors.

(B) An inability to bui1d or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships
with peers and teachers.

(C) Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circumstances.
(D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.

(E) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with
personal or school problems.
34 CFR 300.8 (c)(4)(i).

4. These conditions were demonstrated by the Student before the Student’s unilateral
placement. His grades were in constant decIine since entering the high school; the
Student was supposed to return to the school after his illness: he did not return. The
Student’s doctor diagnosed the Student with a grave depression. The school counselor
recommended therapists to the Parents. The Student was not attending his home bound
classes. The Student was having issues with his Parents. The Board did not decide to
recommend the Student for special education or evaluate him but referred him to a
Section 504 Multidisciplinary Team. (Findings of Fact Nos. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13,16 and 17)

5. The Student was found eligible requiring 504 services under the disability of
Depression. There were no evaluations performed to measure the Student’s abilities.
(Finding Of Fact No. 14) Evaluation must be based on tests and other materials that have

been validated and will measure the abilities, rather than the disabilities of the child. 34
CFR. §300. 104.35.

6. The Board had opportunity and reasons to seek evaluations of the Student in a timely
manner and did not. The Board has an afﬁrmative obligation to seek out IDEA eligible
students. 101., Compton. The Board violated child ﬁnd by failing in a timely manner to
seek out the Student as potentially IDEA eligible and refer him for an evaluation. The
Student’s suicidal ideations did not trigger a need to evaluate the Student. The team
stated that they needed more information, but did nothing to obtain it. (Finding of Fact
N0. 17) It was not until the Parents’ out—of-district placement did the Board consider
IDEA. The continued absenteeism with his falling grades and the school counselor’s
concerns should have triggered child ﬁnd. A district may not take a passive approach and
wait for others to refer the student for special education services. Id. This is a FAPE
violation and in the instant case, a denial of FAPE.

SECOND NATURE
7. The Parents seek reimbursement for their unilateral placement of the Student at
Second Nature in Georgia. In order to receive reimbursement for tuition for a unilateral

private school placement, three elements must be established by the evidence in the

10

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No, 14-0296

record: 1) that the school district has denied FAPE to the student or otherwise violated
IDEA; 2) that the parent's private school placement is appropriate; and 3) that equitable
factors do not preclude the relief. School Committee Town of Burlington v. Department
ofEduc., 471 U.S. 359, 105 S. Ct. 1996, 103 L.R.P. 37667 (U.S. 1985); Florence County
School District Four v. Carter,_510 U.S. 7, 114 S. Ct. 361, 20 IDELR 532 (U.S.

1993); Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T. A., 557 U.S. 230, 129 S. Ct. 2484,52 IDELR

151 (U.S. 2009). In the instant case, the ﬁrSt prong of the analysis in a unilateral
placement is whether the district/board violated IDEA. The violation of child ﬁnd
requirements, Supra, at the time of placement, resulted in the district/board failing to

provide an appropriate program to the Student and therefore a ﬁnding of a denial of
FAPE.

8. The second prong of the analysis in a unilateral placement case involves an analysis of
whether the private school at which the parents unilaterally placed the student is
appropriate. In the instant case, the Parents placed the student in a private school: Second
Nature. The educational program provided by Second Nature does not provide any
educational beneﬁt. The purpose of Second Nature is to make the Student more
responsible; the academic work performed by the Student was done independently.
Biology credit was given for living out doors and English credits were given for
maintaining a journal. The credits obtained at Second Nature were not accepted by J DA.
(F indings of Fact Nos. 20, 22 and 23). Because the private school selected by the
Parents failed to meet the Student's individual needs and provide educational beneﬁt, it is
not appropriate. Accordingly, it is concluded that the evidence in the record
demonstrates that the private school selected by the (Second Nature) Parents for the

unilateral placement of the Student is not appropriate. Reimbursement for the unilateral
placement at Second Nature must be denied.

9. The third prong of the analysis in a unilateral placement case involves an analysis of
whether the equities, based upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case, would
justify reimbursement. In the instant case, the unrebutted evidence presented is that the
Parents did not give timely notice to the Board of their intent to unilaterally place the
Student at Second Nature. Failure to comply with the notice requirement will not result
in a denial or reduction of reimbursement if compliance would have resulted in serious
emotional harm to the Student. 34 C.F.R. §300.l48 (e)(2)(ii). Evidence was not
presented that giving the required notice would have resulted in serious emotional harm.
The therapist at Second Nature testiﬁed that the Student’s behavior, when he arrived, was
that he did not want to be there and that he felt inadequate. This inadequacy was caused
by his mother managing him. (Finding of Fact No. 20) The Parents failed to give proper
notice. Based on this analysis, the Parents are not entitled to any reimbursement for their
placement of the Student at Second Nature because the Student was not receiving any

educational beneﬁt at Second Nature and they failed to give the required notice without
just cause.

JOHN DEWEY ACADEMY AUGUST 9, 2013 T0 SEPTEMBER 3, 2013

10. The placement at JDA from August 9, 2013 to September 3, 2013 was appropriate.

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

1 1. There was no convincing testimony provided that the unilateral placement was not
appropriate and did not provide educational beneﬁt to the Student or that there was
another program available to the Student during that period. The Board alleges that the
Student does not need an extended school year in order to receive FAPE. At this time,
the Board had not evaluated the Student to determine an appropriate program. At the
September 3, 2013 PPT, the Board recommended JDA as the diagnostic placement for
the Student and had determined that the Student required special education and related
services. (Findings of Fact Nos. 1 and 32). The evaluation performed by Dr. Harvey
recommended a residential therapeutic intervention. There was no convincing evidence
offered that at the time of the placement the Student did not need a residential placement
in order to receive FAPE. The Board shall be responsible for the residential placement at
JDA from August 9, 2013 to September 3, 2013.

ARCH/CLP

12. The Student, in this matter, was later found to be eligible as a student with an
Emotional Disturbance. (F indings Of Fact No. 1)

13. Once a Board has identiﬁed a child as eligible for IDEA services, it must create and
implement an IEP based on the student's needs and areas of disability. Boards are not,
however, required to “maximize the potential” of each handicapped student Bd. afEduc.
OfHendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowle , 458 US 176, 197 n. 21 (1982)). Instead,
to satisfy the IDEA, the Board must offer an IEP that is “reasonably calculated” to enable
the child to receive “meaningful” educational beneﬁts in light of the student‘s intellectual
potential. Id, at 206-207. Once the Board has designed and administered an IEP that is
reasonably calculated to enable the receipt of meaningful educational beneﬁts, it has
satisﬁed its obligation to provide the child with FAPE.

14. 1f the Parent or the Student is not satisﬁed or believes that the program wil1 not
provide FAPE, they can challenge the educational placement. 34 C.F.R. §300.507(a)(1).
It is the Board’s responsibility to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the

appropriateness of the program and placement it has provided to the Student. CGS §10-
76h-14(a).

15. The standard for determining whether a Board has provided a free appropriate public
education is set forth as a two-part inquiry in Rowley. It must ﬁrst be determined whether
the Board complied with the procedural requirements of IDEA. The second inquiry is a
determination of whether the IEP is “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive
educational beneﬁts.” Id. at 206-207.

16. The IDEA’s procedural requirements and safeguards are designed to assure that the
parents of a child with a disability have a full and meaningful opportunity to participate
along with LEA personnel in developing, reviewing and revising their child’s IEP.
Comp1ianee with the IDEA’s procedural requirements is the responsibility of the Board
and not the Parents. Unified Sch. Dist. vi Dept. of Ed., 64 Conn. App. 273, 285 (2001).

12

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

Procedural violations alone can be deemed a denial of FAPE. Student v. Newtown

B. 0.E._, CT DOE Case No. 07-075 (8/23/07). In order to conclude that procedural
violations resulted in a denial of a FAPE, the Parents must show that the procedural
errors resulted in a loss of educational opportunity. Id. at 22; See, Burke County Bd. of
Ed. v. Demon, 895 F.2d 973, 982 (4th Cir, 1999); Evans v. District No. 17, 841 F.2d 824,
830 (8th Cir. 1988); WG. v. Bd. of T rustees of Target Range Sch. Dist. N0. 23, 960 F.2d
1479, 1484-85 (9 Cir. 1992). When a procedural violation is alleged, a Hearing Ofﬁcer
may ﬁnd that a Student did not receive F APE if the procedural inadequacies impeded the
child’s right to FAPE, signiﬁcantly impeded the Parents’ opportunity to participate in the
decision—making process regarding the provision of a FAPE to the Parents’ child, or
caused a deprivation of educational beneﬁt. 34 CFR §300.513(a) (2) (i-iii); Id. at 22; See,
Burke at 982; Evans at 830; W. G. at 1484-8. Procedural violations that interfere with
Parents' participation in the IEP formulation process undermine the very essence of
IDEA. Amanda J. ex rel Annette J. v. Clark County Sch. Dist, 267 F.3d 877 (9th Cir.
2001). An IEP addresses the unique needs of the child and cannot be developed if those
people most familiar with the child’s needs are not involved or fully informed. Id.
Procedural safeguards are set forth in 20 U.S.C. §l415 and 34 CFR §§500-536 and
include: the right for Parents to participate in all meetings (CFR §300.501(b); the right
for Parental involvement in placement decisions (CFR §300.501(c)); the right of Parents
to examine all educational records (CFR §300.501(a)); the right for Parents to obtain an
Independent Educational Evaluation (lEE) of their child (§300.502(b); the requirement
for Boards to consider evaluations provided by Parents at private expense in the deciding
FAPE (CRF §300.502(c)). IDEA expects strong Parental input at PPT meetings, Warren
G. v. Cumberland County Sch. Dist, 190 F. 3d 80, 86 (3d Cir. 1993). The IEP is to
be collaborative developed by the Parents of the Student, educators and other specialists.
Congress repeatedly emphasized the “importance and indeed the necessity of Parental
participation in both the development of the IEP and any subsequent assessments.” Honig
v. Doe 484 US. 305, 311 (1988). F ailure by the Board to develop an IEP in accordance
with procedures mandated by IDEA, in and of itself, can be deemed a denial of FAPE.
Amanda J. ex rel Annette J. v. Clark County Sch.Dist._, 267 F.3d 877 (9th Cir.2001).

17. The Parents allege that they were not allowed meaningful palticipation at the PPT.
At three PPTs, September 3, 17 and October 1, 2013, the Parents were represented by
counsel and the attorney attended the PPT with the Parents. At the September 3, 2013
PPT, the IDA unilateral placement was recommended as a diagnostic placement and the
PPT, which included the Parent, agreed. At the September 17, 2013 PPT, the Parents
requested reimbursement for the unilateral placement at Second Nature. The Board heard
the Parents’ request and stated they needed more information. At the October 15 , 2013
PPT, the Parents requested the addition of a goal to the IEP and the Board included the
requested goal. (B-3, B-4 B-5 and Findings of Fact No. 35) That the staff members of
the PPT do not agree with everything the Parent requests does not mean that they are not
meaningful participants. The Parents alleged that the Student’s IEP was predetermined
before the October 15, 2013 PPT. The copy given to the Parents before the meeting is
clearly marked “draft” and, as stated Supra, the Parents requested the addition of a goal
to the IEP and the Board included the requested goal. The Board considered the Parents’
out-of—district placement at IDA and did not agree with it, even though it had been used

13

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

by the Board as a diagnostic placement for the Student. I disagree that the IEP offered by
the Board was predetermined before the PPT meeting. The Parents were meaningful
participants of the PPTS.

18. The Second prong in Rowley is whether the IEP is “reasonably calculated to enable
the child to receive educational beneﬁts.” Id. at 206-207. The IEP is the "centerpiece of
the [IDEA's] education delivery system for disabled children" and consists of a detailed
written statement that must be developed, reviewed, and revised for each child with a
disability. (Ham'g v. Doe (1988) 484 US. 305, 311 [108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686]; 20
U.S.C. 20 U.S.C.§1401 (14), 1414 (d)(1)(A). An IEP is evaluated in light of information
available at the time it was developed, and is not to be evaluated in hindsight. (Adams v.
State ofOregon (9th Cir. 1999) 195 F.3d 1141, 1149 (Adams).) [A]n IEP "is a snapshot,
not a retrospective." The IEP must be evaluated in terms of what was obj ectively
reasonable when it was developed. (Ibid)

19. An annual IEP must materially meet the content requirements of IDEA and the
Connecticut corollary to IDEA, both of which require the IEP to be in writing and
contain: a statement of the student's present levels of academic achievement; a statement
of measurable annual goals; a description of the manner in which progress toward the
goals will be made; a statement of the special education and related services, and
supplementary aids to be provided to the student; an explanation of the extent, if any, to
which the pupil will not participate with non—disabled pupils in regular classes and
activities; a statement of individual appropriate accommodations necessary to measure a
student‘s academic achievement and functional performance on state and district
assessments; projected services start dates, duration, frequency, location of services and
modiﬁcations. The Parents’ concerns (Finding of Fact No. 36) were unfounded. While
the Student was at J DA he did not receive individual counseling sessions for two weeks

and there were no setbacks. Testimony elicited from the Director of J DA was that
individual therapy is “as needed”.

20. The federal law requires that handicapped children be educated with non—disabled
peers to the maximum extent appropriate. 20 U.S.C. §1412(a)(5); 34'CFR §300.114.
However, a district must make any placement and service decisions for a child based om
their individual need. 34 CFR §300.39. A comparison must be made between the
educational beneﬁts the child will receive in the regular classroom and the beneﬁts the
child will receive in a segregated program. Obertz’ v Board of Education of the Borough
of Clementon School District, 995 R1204, 1220 (3d Cir. 1993). A segregated setting may
be the most appropriate and least restrictive environment for the student. 1n the instant
case, the Board has decided that a placement in an alternative setting other than the
mainstream high school is appropriate for the Student. I disagree.

21. The record demonstrates that the Student is doing well at J DA. The Board’s program
offered the Student one-on-one classes in core courses like calculus while other courses
would be modiﬁed to meet the his needs. These modiﬁcations can be provided in a
mainstream setting. Calculus does not have to be on-on-one since it is a regular course in
the mainstream setting. There is no need to isolate the Student so he can receive classes

14

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

that will prepare him in his post graduate endeavors. The Board observers reported that
the Student is articulate and engaged in class participation. Nothing in their report
indicates that participation in the mainstream setting with related services would be
detrimental to the Student or that an alternative setting is the LRE for the Student.
Counseling sessions can and should be provided in a mainstream setting. The Student
requires a challenging program, and this could be accomplished with his peers.
Mentoring can be done in a mainstream setting; the Student does not have to be in an
alternative school to receive FAPE. The Student is a bright young man who, with proper
guidance, mentoring and an educational program with related services, will become an
asset to his community. The program offered by the Board is not appropriate.

J OHN DEWEY ACADEMY OCTOBER 15, 2013 TO END OF 2013-2014 SCHOOL YEAR

22. When a parent believes that a public educational placement is denying her child
F APE, the parent may choose to remove the child to a private placement. However, a
parent who removes the child does so at "their own ﬁnancial risk." W. G. v. Board of
Trustees of T arget Range Sch. Dist. No. 23, 18 IDELR 1019 (9th Cir. 1992). See
also Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 20 IDELR 532 (U .S.1993). This means
that a parent may have to pay in full for the cost of the private placement.
A parent may seek district reimbursement for the private placement if:
a. The educational program recommended by the IEP was inappropriate to meet the
child's needs.
b. The alternative placement or additional services selected by the parents were
appropriate.
0. Equitable factors weigh in favor of reimbursement.

T. Y. v. New York City Dep't of Educ, 53 IDELR 69 (2d Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 110 LRP
28696, 130 S. Ct. 3277 (2010

23. The unilateral placement at J DA is appropriate and does allow the Student to obtain
educational beneﬁts. Unilaterally placed students need not receive services pursuant to
an IEP in order to obtain an award of tuition reimbursement. The IEP requirements do
not apply if a child with a disability is unilaterally placed by the child's parents. The
IDEA'S requirements that FAPE must be provided under public supervision, meet the
standards of the state educational agency, and be provided in accordance with an IEP are
binding on public agencies, but they do not make sense in the context of a unilateral
private placement. Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 20 IDELR 532

(U .S. 1 993).

24. The diagnostic placement at J DA demonstrated that the Student can obtain
educational beneﬁts at JDA, but it also shows that the Student does not need a residential
placement in order to receive a meaningful education. The Parents’ placement at JDA is
premised on their belief that the Student cannot function in the Board’s environment and
requires 24/7 supervision in order to receive FAPE. The Student needs supervision in
order to ensure he uses his time wisely. This can be accomplished with goals and

obj ectives in his IEP, a functional behavioral assessment in order to identify any stressors
and a behavior intervention plan to help him cope and overcome them. The Parents

15

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

concern is the Student’s access to the computer and obsession with video games.
Isolating him from the world does not resolve the issue. (Findings of Fact No. 39) The
Parent-Child Relationship has been identiﬁed as a cause for the Student’s depression,
anxiety and school refusal. (Findings of Fact Nos. 12, 20, 27). A residential program to
cope with this issue is not something the Board needs to pay for in order to provide the
Student with FAPE. The diagnostic placement shows that the Student can progress and
receive a meaningful education. The Student was able to function without individual
counseling and, if required, it is on an as needed basis. (Findings of F act Nos. 35 and
37). The Student does not need an out of district residential placement in order to receive
a meaningful education just as he does not need an alternative placement in the district to
receive FAPE. The Student can receive an appropriate education in the Board’s
mainstream setting but this was not provided. The residential placement was to alleviate
the tension in the home environment and to address the Student’s depression and anxiety:
s residential placement is needed to address these issues. The Board shall pay for the

educational portion of the Student’s placement. The Parents shall be responsible for the
residential portion.

REIMBURSEMENT FOR EVALUATION

25. The evaluation performed by Dr. Quentin Harvey was at Parents’ request. The
Parents patiently waited for the Board to contact them about the evaluator but the Board
did not. (Findings of Fact No. 25) The Board utilized Dr. Harvey’s report in the IDEA
determination. (F inding of Fact No. 32). The Board shall pay for the cost associated
with the Psychological Evaluation performed by Dr. Quentin Harvey.

COMPENSATORY EDUCATION

26. The Parents are entitled to compensatory education for the denial of FAPE. The
purpose of compensatory education is not to provide additional beneﬁts to the student,
but rather to put the student in the position he would have occupied if the district had
complied with its IDEA obligations. As such, many courts have rejected a "cookie-
cutter" approach to compensatory education in which awards are based solely on the
hours of services missed. See, e.g. Reid v. District 0fColumbia,_43 IDELR 32_(D.C. Cir.
2005). The award of compensatory education remains in the broad discretion of the
court. Garcia v. Board of Educ. ofAlbuquerque Pub. Schs,”49 IDELR 241_(10th Cir.
2008). Hearing Ofﬁcers have the authority to provide compensatory education as an
equitable remedy for denial of FAPE. Student v. Greenwich 8.0. E., CT DOE Case No.
06-005 at 19; Inquiry ofKohn, 17 EHLR 522 (OSEP) (2/ 13/91) (citing with approval
Lester H v. Gilhool, 916 F.2d 865 (3d Cir. 1990); Burr v. Ainbach, 863 F.2d 1071 (2d
Cir. 1988), vacated, 492 U.S. 902, reaffd, 888 F,2d 258 (2d Cir. 1989). Compensatory
education has been recognized as an available remedy under IDEA for failure of the
Board to provide FAPE. See, KP. v. Juzwic, 891 F .Supp, 703 (D.Conn. 1995); Burr v.
Atnbcteh, 863 F.2d 1071 (2d Cir. 1988); Mrs. C. v. Wheaten, 916 F.2d 69 (2d Cir. 1990).

16

 

June 10, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 14-0296

27. The Board’s violation of child ﬁnd is a denial of FAPE (Conclusion of Law No. 7)
and entitles the Student to Compensatory Education. The compensatory remedy for the
denial of FAPE is that the Board shall pay for all costs associated with the residential
placement of the Student at J DA from the time of his initial placement to the publishing
of this decision, June 10, 2014. This shall place the Student in the equitable position he
would have been in had FAPE been provided. This does not mean that the Student
requires a residential placement in order to receive FAPE. (Conclusions of Law Nos. 24—
26) This provision of compensatory education is an equitable remedy for the denial of
FAPE. (Conclusions of Law Nos. 3-7)

28. To the extent a procedural claim raised by the Parent is not speciﬁcally addressed
herein, the Hearing Ofﬁcer has concluded that the claim lacked merit.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

l.

The Board violated child ﬁnd by not identifying the Student as requiring special
education and related services.

The Board does not have to reimburse the Parents for the cost, including transportation,
for the unilateral placement at Second Nature.

The Board shall pay for the residential placement of the Student at J DA from August 9,
2013 to September 3, 2013.

The Program offered by the Board for the 2013-2014 school year is not appropriate.

The unilateral placement of the Student at J DA does provide the Student with a
meaningful education.

The Parents will be reimbursed for cost incurred for the educational portion of the
unilateral placement of the Student at JDA from October 15, 2013 to the end of the 2013—

2014 school year. The Parent is responsible for the residential costs of the placement.

The Parents shall be reimbursed for the cost of the evaluation performed by Dr. Quinten
Harvey.

The Board did not commit procedural violations and did allow the Parents to be
meaningful panicipants of the planning and placement team (PPT).

The Student is entitled to compensatory education for the Board’s denial of FAPE. The
Board shall pay all costs associated with the residential placement at JDA from October
