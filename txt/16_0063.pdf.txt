Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on the same day and conducted a Prehearing Conference on
August 6, 2015. The mailing date of the decision was extended so that the parties could engage
in mediation and the hearing was scheduled for October 20, 2015. On the ﬁrst day of hearing,
the parties jointly requested a postponement of the hearing date and an extension of the mailing
