SUMMARY:

The Student is seriously disabled. Parents requested, and were granted funding for
independent evaluations. Given the results of these evaluations, Parents requested
placement of the Student at the Speech Academy, a private school for students with
disabilities. When the Board denied funding of that placement, the Parents placed the
Student there unilaterally and ﬁled for a special education hearing.

members and other witnesses in place of names and other personally identiﬁable

information.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The dispute having been settled and the request for hearing having been withdrawn, this
case is DISMISSED with prejudice, as requested by the Parties.
