FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUE:

Did the District err when the Planning and Placement Team (PPT) determined that the Student
was not eligible for Special Education under the eligibility category of Emotional Disturbance at
the Planning and Placement Team meeting on October 23, 2015?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On November 11, 2015, the Board received a Special Education Due Process Hearing Request
ﬁled by Attorney for the Student. The Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on November 12, 2015.
During the prehearing conference held on December 3, 2015, hearing dates were set and the
deadline for mailing the F inal Decision and Order was established as January 22, 2016.
December 23, 2015 was originally identiﬁed as a potential hearing date, contingent on
availability of an expert witness. On December 8, 2015, Attorney for the Student indicated her
expert witness was not available, and so February 8, 2016 was established as the day on which
the hearing was to begin. Attorney for the Student requested an extension of the mailing deadline
in order to accommodate the agreed upon hearing date schedule. After a consideration of all of
the relevant factors this request was granted, resulting in a deadline of F ebruary 19, 2016. On
February 8, 2016, Attorney for the Parent indicated that the parties had executed a settlement
agreement and that the Special Education Due Process Request was being withdrawn.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

In light of the above facts, the case is dismissed.

 

If the local 01' regional board of education or the uniﬁed school distﬁct responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
aetion on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take apprbpriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings 01‘ prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal

court by either party in accordance With the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
