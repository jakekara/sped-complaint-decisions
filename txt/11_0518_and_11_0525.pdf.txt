FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUE:

Whether the Student’s conduct which resulted in the pending disciplinary action was caused by
or had a direct and substantial relationship to the Student’s disability, or whether the conduct in
question was the direct result of the Board’s failure to implement the IEP.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:

These two requests for hearing, one ﬁled on behalf of the Student by the Aunt and one ﬁled on behalf of
the Student by the Grandfather, were received by the Board on June 16 and June 20, 2011. A preheating
conference was convened by the undersigned hearing ofﬁcer on June 2, 201 1 and the two cases were

consolidated.

On J uly 8, 2011 the Family’s attorney submitted a “Motion to Withdraw Part of the Above Referenced
Exediated [sic] Request for Due Process Cases.” In the body of the motion, the Family’s attorney
requests that the Request for Due Process in connection with the manifestation hearing be withdrawn
without prejudice, but that the additional issues in the case “remain untouched.” As the sole issue in this
consolidated matter is the manifestation determination, this matter is hereby dismissed. This decision
does not relate to the new request for hearing which has been submitted to the due process unit also
dated July 8, 201 land has not yet been assigned to a hearing ofﬁcer.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED, without prejudice,
