December 2, 2003 -1- Final Decision and Order 03-313   STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION   Student  v.  Bridgeport Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parents:   Mother, pro se  Appearing on behalf of the Board:   Attorney  Susan C. Freedman Shipman & Goodwin LLP One American Row Hartford, CT  06103-2819  Appearing before:    Attorney Patricia M. Strong Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   PROCEDURAL HISTORY   This hearing was requested on September 24, 2003.  This hearing officer was assigned to the case on September 25.  A prehearing conference was held on October 20.  The issue presented by the Mother was a disagreement with the placement of the student at CES in Trumbull.  At that time the parties asked for additional time for mediation.  The Board's attorney requested a 30-day postponement for purposes of scheduling mediation and exploring settlement options, which was granted.  The decision deadline was extended to December 10 and a hearing date was agreed on for December 1, 2003.  On November 25, the Mother sent a letter to the Hearing Officer via fax requesting cancellation of the hearing date for the stated reason that she had agreed to an independent evaluation.  The Mother stated that she was aware that she could file due process "at another time."   The parties were advised on November 25 that the hearing was cancelled and that a dismissal without prejudice would be issued by a written decision and order from the Hearing Officer.    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  Although the Parent's request to cancel the December 1 hearing did not specify whether she wished to withdraw the case, it is apparent that she does not wish to prosecute it further.  It is ordered that the case shall be dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Regulations of Conn. State Agencies, Section 10-76h-18(a)(1).
