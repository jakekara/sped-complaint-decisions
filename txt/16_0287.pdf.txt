deadline for mailing the F inal Decision and Order was established as May 6, 2016. On March
21, 2016, Attorney for the Parents sent a letter to the Hearing Ofﬁcer in which she requested an
extension of the mailing deadline in order to allow the parties to engage in mediation. Parents’

factors and ﬁnding that a postponement would not cause educational harm to the child, not cause
ﬁnancial or other harm to the parties, this request was granted and June 28, 2016 was set as the
