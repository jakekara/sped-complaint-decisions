FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Did the Wilton Board of Education (“Board”) fail to provide the Student with a free
and appropriate public education (“FAPE”) during the 2014 7 2015 academic years?

2. Does the Student require an out—of—district school placement, and if so, is the Winston
Preparatory School an appropriate placement?

at Winston Preparatory School for the 2014-2015 academic years?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Parents ﬁled this request for due process on J anuary 14, 2015. A preheating
conference was held on J anuary 30, 2015, from which the issues listed above were
identiﬁed. Initial due process hearings were set for March 10 and March 12, 2015. The
March 10, 2015 hearing date was subsequently cancelled due to a scheduling error. On
