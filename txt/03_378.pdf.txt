2003 the parent was notified by telephone of the prehearing conference call scheduled for November 28, 2003.  The parent did not respond to the call or participate in the 
prehearing conference.   The parent was notified of another prehearing conference call but did not participate.   Three weeks later the parent left the hearing officer a telephone message that they would be available to participate in a prehearing conference.  The date 

and time suggested was not arranged as a mutually agreeable time with the LEA&#8482;s 
counsel or the hearing officer.
