        FINAL DECISION  
 The prehearing conference in this matter 
was held on December 19, 2006.  Both parties 
were represented by counsel who participated.  Dates for hearing were selected.  The 
student agreed to an extension of the date for mailing of the final decision to 
accommodate the scheduling issues of the parties. The issues included extended year 
services; failure to properly evaluate and program, including failure to provide 
appropriate related services; reimbursement for various independent evaluations; assistive 
technology evaluation and services; and compensatory educ
ation. The Parents reported that although the issues were not resolved they were withdrawing their request for hearing in that they were hopeful that the matter would be
 resolved through the PPT process, which had begun and was set to continue later in the week of the first date of 
hearing.     FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
  The hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
