FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY:

The Student is a student who has been as identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive
a free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”) as deﬁned in the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and
Connecticut General Statute §10-76a. At a PPT meeting, the Parent rejected the program
offered by the Board for the 2010-201 1 school year. The Parent requested a specialized
program; the Board refused the Parent’s request. The parties agreed to go to mediation in
place of a resolution meeting. The mediation was held on November 9, 2010 but the
matter was not resolved. The matter proceeded to hearing.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes
(CGS) §10-76h and related regulations, 20 United States Code§1415(f) and related
regulations, and in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, CGS
§§4-1766 to 4—178, inclusive, and §4-181a and §4-186.

On 01' about October 7, 2010, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request for due
process. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on October 18, 2010 and a pre—
hearing conference was held on October 25, 2010. The matter proceed to hearings on the
following dates: December 2, 7, and 14, 2010; January 18 and 25, 2011; Febmary 8 and
9, 2011; and March 9 and 14, 15 and 17, 2011 and Ap1‘114 and 6, 2011.

The parties in this matter have all presented retrospective testimony and exhibits by
which the parties are attempting to either show progress or the lack thereof. These
retrospective evaluations and testimony are not what the PPT had at their disposal to
determine the IEP for the 2010—201 1 school year. Whether a student was denied FAPE is
determined by looking to what was reasonable at the time, not in hindsight. (Adams v.
Stale Q/‘Oregon (9th Cir. 1999) 195 Fed 1 141, citing F uhrmann v. East Hanover Bd. of
Education (3d Cir. 1993) 993 F.2d 1031, 1041 (hei‘eaﬁer Fuhrmann).) The relevance of a
student‘s subsequent performance to the adequacy of his IEP is limited. In Adams, parents
who had supplemented their child's education with private tutoring challenged the
adequacy of an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) (the equivalent of an IEP for
infants and toddlers) on the ground that the child's subsequent lack of progress in school
demonstrated the inadequacy of the IFSP. The District Court found it impossible to 3011
out the progress the child made. The Ninth Circuit, however, rejected that approach. It
stated that instead of asking whether the IFSP was adequate in light of the student's

August 2, 2011 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0154

progress, the district court should have asked the more peltinent question of whether the
IFSP was appropriately designed and implemented so as to convey a meaningful beneﬁt
to the student. The coutt rejected the process of measuring an IFSP (and, by analogy, an
IEP) retroactively by its results. Instead ofjudging the IF SP in hindsight, the proper
analysis was to look at the IFSP'S goals, placement and services at the time the plan was
developed and ask whether the methods were reasonably calculated to confer the student
with a meaningﬁil benefit. The eouit stated that the IFSP was a snapshot, not a
retrospective, and had to take into account what was and what was not objectively
reasonable when the snapshot was taken. (Ibid) A Monday night quarterback will be able
to address what should have been done but the team that has the responsibility of calling
the plays can only work with what they have at their disposal, I agree with the Parent that
Hartford Board Exhibit 13 is retrospective evidence and as stated in D.F. v. Ramapo
Cent. School District, 430 F,3d 595, the Second Circuit declined to decide the issue,
preferring to let the lower count consider the issue in the ﬁrst instance. 1d. at 600. The
observation of Dr. Mayville on December 10, 2010, Haﬁford Board Exhibit 13, the
observation of Dr. Allen and the testimony solicited from these exhibits and reports is
retrospective evidence not available to the PPT to review in order to decide the program
for the 2010—201 1 school year and will not be used in determining if the program offered
the Student FAPE.

This Final Decision and Order sets folth the Hearing Officer’s summary, ﬁndings of fact
and conclusions of law. The ﬁndings of facts and conclusions of law set forth herein,
which reference cettain exhibits and witness testimony, are not meant to exclude other
supported evidence in the record. All evidence presented was considered in deciding this
matte!“ T0 the extent that the Summary and Proposed Findings of Fact actually represent
conclusions of law, they should be so considered by the Hearing Officer and vice versa,

1985); Bonnie Ann F. v. Callallen Ind. Sch. Bd., 835 F. Supp. 340 (SD. Tex. 1993)

FINDINGS OF FACT:

1. The Student is a student who has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to
receive a FAPE as defined in IDEAt (Testimony of Father, Parent’s Exhibits] )

2. The Student commenced his education in the Board’s schools. A PPT was convened
at the commencement ot‘the Student’s Head Stait program and evaluations were
ordered. The PPT found that the Student demonstrated signiﬁcant delays in all
developmental areas. The Student was initially classiﬁed as Developmentally
Delayed. ( P—2)

' Hereaﬂer Parent’s Exhibits will be designated in this decision with a “P" followed by the exhibit number,
Exhibits from the Student’s home district will be references with a “B” followed by the exhibit number.
Exhibits from the District where the Magnet School is located will be references by “MS” followed by the
exhibit number.

2 The Magnet School the Student currently attends is not in his home district. This matter involves two
districts, the student’s home district which hereafter shall be referred to as the “Board”, and the district
where the Magnet school the Student attends is located which hereafter shall be refen‘ed to as the “Magnet
School”.

August 2, 201 1 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0154

In 2004 the PPT ordered full evaluations of the Student in order to determine
programming needs, speciﬁc special education diagnosis, and Parent’s concern about
the Student’s behavior. The Diagnostic evaluation found that in the Kaufman
Assessment Battery for Children, the Student was functioning in the borderline range
of Intelligence with a composite score of 75. The Behavior Assessment for Children
showed that the Student had signiﬁcant levels 01" inattention and atypically across
settings. The Childhood Autism Rating Scales were suggestive of moderate autism
and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales revealed low levels of self-help skills in
the areas ol‘communication, daily living skills, and socialization. The Student was
found to be academically below grade level in all subject areas. (P-6, P-lO)

A Physical Therapy Diagnostic Evaluation was also performed of the Student. The
evaluator found that the Student continued to demonstrate a gait pattern that had not
signiﬁcantly changed. The evaluator repoﬂed that continued physical therapy would
not impact his gait pattern and that this did not prevent the Student from participating
in school—based activities. The evaluator recommended that physical therapy be
discontinued. An Occupational Therapy Diagnostic Evaluation was also conducted
and the evaluator recommended that occupational therapy be continued for the
Student. (P-7, P—8)

A speech and language evaluation was also conducted Ofthe Student. The
assessments showed that the Student’s receptive and expressive language skills was
below his age and grade equivalent peers. His language skills showed weaknesses in
semantics, language structure, and integrative language skills. The Student’s speech
intelligibility was also moderately impaired. (P—9)

On or about March 2004, a PPT was convened to review the results of the
evaluations. The PPT changed the Student’s classiﬁcation to Autism and found that
based on the evaluation, physical therapy should be discontinued. (P- l 0)

On or about March 2006, the PPT recommended a psychological evaluation of the
Student because of disruptive, off task behaviors which were affecting his academic
performance. Dr. Felicia Morgan provided a consultation surmnaly in which she
noted that there was no consistent behavior plan and recommended that one needs to
be developed with the focus on task behaviors, being appropriate with others, and
following directions. (P-23)

On or about March 2007, triennial evaluations were done by the Board of the Student.

The evaluator performed a Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales (RIAS). The
assessments showed that the Student was in the mildly deﬁcient range in the verbal
and non~Verba| intellectual score; in the overall domains the Student was moderately
deﬁcient. The evaluator noted that in comparison to the Kaufman Assessment Battery
for Children, which was performed in 2004, the results of the RIAS were lower. On
the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 2"d Edition, his adaptive functioning
appeared higher than expected in comparison to his IQ of 51. In his speech and

language evaluation, the Student demonstrated weaknesses in receptive, expressive
and pragmatic language skills which impact his participation and performance within
the general curriculum. (P—28)

On or about March 18, 2008, the PPT met in order to plan the Student’s 2008-2009
school year. The Present Levels of Educational Performance indicated that (a) the
Student had “a difﬁcult time with the comprehension ofreading skills, particularly
making connections, retelling stories, weak ﬂuency skills”; (b) Formation and
directionality of letters and numbers need improvement; and (c) the Student was
unable to write legibly at a pace which enables him to keep up with class work.
Modiﬁcations were provided to assist in overcoming the impact the Student’s
disability was having on his involvement and Progress in the educational program and
appropriate school activities. (Testimony of 5" Grade Special Education teacher, P-
36)

The March 18, 2008 PPT established team consultation time with the Student’s
school providers twice a month. The Parent requested to attend these sessions. The
request to attend these meetings was granted and the father was invited to the team
meetings. The Parent did not attend the meetings. (P~36, Testimony 01‘5‘h Grade
Special Education teacher)

The PPT established detailed goals and objectives to address the Student’s reading
deﬁcit, math deﬁciencies in computation, reasoning skills and written language skills.
The team considered assistive technology for the Student and agreed that he was
successﬁtl with the word processor and created goals to increase his typing skills.
Goals were also written to improve his receptive and expressive language skills and a
social skills goal was developed to address his behavior with his peers. A BCBA was
not involved in the Student’s program. The Parent requested an independent
educational evaluation. (P—36, Testimony of Father)

The speech and language pathologist drafted the Student’s goal and objectives for the
2008—2009 school year. The Student was able to communicate and engage with adults
more than with other Students. The speech and language goal was written to address
the Student’s deﬁcits in receptive and expressive language and improve the Student’s
ability to comprehend class instructions and thereby increase his participation in the
classroom. The Student’s goal and objective was developed to also reduce the
Student’s impulsivity. (P-36, Testimony of 2008 Speech and Language Therapist)

The occupational therapist noted that the Student continued to progress with his
typing skills and recommended that the Student use the portable word processor in
the classroom. The occupational therapist recommended that the Student’s word
processor become his and travel with him during the next school year. (P-44)

The Parent had requested a 1-1 special education teacher; at a PPT held June 12, 2008
the team agreed to have the special education teacher work with the Student on a 1:1
basis for one hour each week in the resource room. The team also agreed to provide

the Student with speech and language services during the summer of 2008 to
compensate for the time he lost during the 2007—2008 school year. The Parent
comp1ained about speech and language sewices not being made up in emails he sent
to the Board. These emails relate to the 2007-2008 school year. (P-44, P-103A pgs.
10-1 1)

During the 2008-2009 school year the student received pull out services for writing
and math skills. The Student was able to read but had a deficit in comprehending
what he read. The Student was in a mainstream class room with non disabled peers
with modiﬁcations. The Student had preferential seating, had a desk with a cushion
for his feet and a bin so he could raise his feet. The Student was advised of any
changes in his routine so he would not be caught unaware. The Student’s para-
professional was a college graduate and followed the directions of the special
education teacher. She worked with the Student 1:1 with the intent of making him
independent. In the classroom the Student received instructions from the special
education teacher, the regular education teacher and the paraprofessional. At the end
of his 5‘h grade school year, the Student was able to add single digits but handling
money was difﬁcult for him. (Testimony of SI“ Grade Special Education Teacher)

When the Student misbehaved or was not focused, he was taken for a walk to assist
him in regaining his composure. By the end of his 5‘h grade school year, the student
wanted to remain in the classroom and did not want to take walks. (Testimony 0f 5"1
Grade Special Education Teacher)

On or about July 2008, the Student had a psychological evaluation performed by Dr.
Erik Mayville. The Doctor performed the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, 2"d
Edition and found a highly noticeable difference between the Student’s reading
decoding and reading comprehension abilities. In mathematics and ora1 language the
student performed in the extreme low range. In his written language the Student was
only capable of completing one subset; he performed in the high average range in
spelling. In sentence and paragraph subtests his scores were below the level required
for a norm-based score of these subtests. In the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, 3rd
Edition, the Student performed at a 5 year 2 month age equivalent. In the Vineland
Adaptive Behavior Scales, 2"d Edition, the Parent and his special education teacher
were the reporters. The Parent scored the Student as low in all domains while his
special education teacher scored him as falling at moderate 10w adaptive levels. In the
maladaptive behavior scale the Student’s level was clinically signiﬁcant. The
evaluator gave the Parent and the special education teacher the Social Response Scale
to complete. The results showed that the Student had social difﬁculties at home and in
the school setting. The problems appeared less evident in the school environment.
The Parent’s rating demonstrated severe impairment in contrast to the teacher’s mild
to moderate ratings. (B‘Sla)

Dr. Mayville recognized that an educational program for the student is a complex
task. The Doctor recommended the following: (1) the student’s program should be
overseen by a Board Certiﬁed Behavior Analyst (BCBA); (2) a 1—1 teaching assistant

to facilitate the implementation of academic, communicative and social interaction
programs; (3) teaching staff should demonstrate competency in behavior analytic
procedures; (4) behavior programs to fade away prompting; (5) a home based
program; (6) carefully planned and sequenced language comprehension and
expression programming; and (7) the areas of the Student’s programming central to
his social needs are to be sequentially addressed. (P-Sla)

The Student’s occupational therapy annual review for the 2008-2009 school year
reports that the Student’s typing speed on the word processor had more than doubled,
from 13 wpm to 28—32 wpm, and his accuracy was from 87-92%. The Student needed
verbal prompting to perserverate less on performance outcomes and decrease rate of
speed. The para professional had been shown strategies to help improve his level of
attention. The therapist recommended continued use of the word processor for his
written work and to continue with occupational therapy consultative services. (P—53)

The Student’s speech and language pathologist evaluated the Student’s progress from
January 2009 to March 2009‘ Services during this period concentrated on
comprehension of basic language and answering questions from information he hears.
The Student was working on 2 step direction. The Student had difﬁculty completing
the initial steps of the directions but could be successful in the latter step. He
demonstrated difﬁculty with open-ended questions but was successful in identifying
ideas and facts that held his interest. (P—SS)

The special education teacher met with the Parent in November and March 2008 to go
over Student’s progress. At the March 9, 2009 PPT, the Parent requested that the
speech and language instruction be increased to 3 times a week for 1.5 hours instead
of 2 times a week for one hour. The team did not increase the speech and language
because the para-professional would be able to support speech and language
throughout each day. (Testimony 01‘5‘h Grade Special Education Teacher)

The Student’s progress report for the 2008-2009 school showed that in Goal 1, he had
mastered one objective and had made satisfactory progress overall 0n the Goal. In his
math Goal 2, the Student made less than satisfactory progress. In his written
language, Goal 3, the student had mastered one objective and had made overall
satisfactory progress in this Goal, In his social behavior Goal, the Student had made
satisfactory progress. The Student attended a homework club to assist him with his
class assigmnents and also his socialization. Goal 5, which addressed the Student‘s
typing skills, showed that the Student had made satisfactory progress. Goal 6
addressed the Student’s deﬁcits in speech and language and showed that the Student
had made satisfactory progress. Goal 7, which addressed the Student’s social and
behavioral deﬁcits, showed that the Student made some progress but in one of the
objectives he made unsatisfactory progress. (P—36, Testimony of 5‘h Grade Special
Education Teacher)

The I’PT met on March 19, 2009 to plan the Student’s program for the 2009-2010

the independent evaluations of Dr. Mayville. The special education teacher did not
attend the PPT. The parent requested a para—professional for the 2009-2010 school
year. (P- 56, Testimony of 5Ih Grade Special Education Teacher)

The Student’s IEP contained 8 Goals. Five of the eight Goals for the 2009-2010
school year were Goals that the Student had from his 2008-2009 school year. The
ﬁrst three academic Goals were the same as the previous school year. The Student
had not mastered any of his Goals during the 2008-2009 school year. The majority of
the objectives for the Goals were not repetitive from the previous school year. The
Student had a total of 46 objectives in his 2009—201 0 IEP of which 7 were repetitive.
In Goal 1, the objectives were reduced from 12 to 9', objectives 4 and 7 were
repetitive from the prior year but were not mastered. In Goal 2, the math goal, the
objectives were reduced from 12 to 9 with objectives 6, 7 and 9 repetitive from the
prior year during which time they had not been mastered. In Goa1 3, the objectives
were increased from 8 t0 9. None of the objectives in Goal 3 were repetitive from the
prior year. The Student’s speech and language Goa1, Goal 6, was the same Goal as the
one utilized in the 2008-2009 school year. The three objectives of Goal 6 were
different. The Student’s social/behavioral Goal was the same Goal as the one utilized
in the 2008—2009 school yeart The social/behavioral objectives were different than the
prior year. (B-36, B-56)

A PPT was held on April 27, 2009 to review Dr. Mayville’s evaluations and Parent’s
request for evaluations. Dr. Mayville attended the PPT Via telephone conference. The
Parent requested occupational therapy evaluations, physical therapy and speech and
language evaluations. These evaluations had just been completed and the Student had
been making progress. The Parent did not request due process for the denial of the
evaluations nor were independent education evaluations requested. (P-61, Testimony
of Coordinator for the Board)

The Parent entered the Student into the choice lottery for the 2009-2010 school year,
The Student received a slot at the Magnet School and on April 23, 2009, the Parent
informed the Magnet School that the Student would be attending the school for the
2009-2010 schoo1 year: The Parent completed the Home Language Survey and
signed the Magnet School Compact. As of then, the Student was ofﬁcially enrolled at
the Magnet School for the 2009-2010 school year. The Father indicated on the
enrollment form that he wanted his son to be mainstreamed for special education. The
special education teacher at the Magnet School, requested that the Parent set up a PPT
meeting with the Home School staff so that she could attend in order to be able to
facilitate the Student's transition to the Magnet School (Testimony of Father,
Testimony of 5‘h Grade Special Education Teacher)

A Physical Therapy Observation Report was prepared after obsewations on May 5,
and 15, 2009. The report noted that physical therapy services were discontinued in
March 2004 because it was felt that continued physical therapy “was not likely to
result in signiﬁcant improvements in his gait pattern”. The report notes that the
Student’s teacher was concerned about the Student’s safety and his slow speed on the

August 2, 20] 1 Final Decision and Order 11—0154

stairs during a recent trip to the Board’s middle school. She also noted his tendency
to lean forward and she expressed concerns regarding his otential to trip and fall. The
report recommended that the Student’s need for physical therapy sewices should be
reassessed when he entered a school that required him to climb stairs. The PT
Obselvation Repont was discussed at the PPT meeting on June 15, 2009, but the PPT
took no action on the report and the reassessment recommended by the evaluation
was not performed. (P—65, P-63, Testimony of Parent).

28. On or about May 26, 2009, the Student had a neuropsychological evaluation
performed at Hattford Hospital. The evaluator was Dr. Joseph Kulas. The evaluation
was provided by the Parent to the Magnet School. A copy was never shared with the
Board until the due process hearing. The evaluation was never discussed at a PPT
meeting. The evaluator performed the RIAS and found the Student in the moderately
impaired range. The evaluator performed the Wider Range Achievement Test—4‘h
Edition and the Student’s reading decoding skills and spelling to dictation were
within the average range. In math computation the student was in the borderline
impaired range. (P-64)

29. Dr. Kulas made various recommendations for the Student:

Improving frustration tolerance;

Decreasing oppositional behaviors;

Improving self—help skills;

That the Student be placed in as small a class as possible;
That time pressure be eliminated;

That Visual and auditory distractions be minimized;
Preferential seating;

Provide frequent short breaks;

Warn the Student about changes in his routine ahead of time;
Provide a calming corner not as a punishment but when he becomes overly
fmstrated 01‘ is near to having a tantrum.

30. A PPT was held on June 15, 2009 at the request of the Parent, in order to conduct a
program review because of the Student’s proposed attendance at the Magnet School.
The PPT was attended by 2 special education teachers from the Magnet School. The
Magnet School personnel were there to obsewe. The parent informed the PPT that the
Student was receiving outside services of physical and occupational therapy. The
special education teacher from the Magnet School informed the PPT that they could
provide the Student’s IEP but needed to check. They would inform the Parent by J uly.
The Board had planned to em'oll the Student in their middle school. (P-65, Testimony
of Coordinator for the Board, Testimony of Special Education Teacher from Magnet
School (SETMS))

31. On J uly 20, 2009, the Parent met with Board personnel and signed an agreement to
change the Student’s IEP without convening a PPT. The Parent refused to send the
Student to the Board’s middle school and instead decided to place the Student at the

Magnet School. The agreement also required that the student have a 1:1 para—
professional, a behavioral consultant for am minimum of 5 hours each week, and
increased speech and language services to 1 ‘/2 hours each week. The Parent was
represented by an advocate. The Magnet School staff was not invited nor did they
participate in the PPT. (B—68, T estimony 01‘ Coordinator for the Board, Testimony 01‘

The Magnet School is one of twelve regional magnet schools operated by the Magnet
School Board of Education pursuant to a Stipulated Agreement between the State of
Connecticut and the plaintiffs in the Shcﬁ’v, 0 ’Neil case. The overall purpose of
magnet schools is to allow students to be educated in a ethnically and racially diverse
educational setting. Approximately 50% of the seats at the Magnet School are
reserved for suburban students. The other 50% are for Magnet School Board of
Education students. Parents who wish their students to attend the Magnet School (and
any other inter-district magnet school) must place their names in a state-run lottely
Students are chosen at random. The Parent must actively accept the seat that is
offered. The Magnet School does not have the right to refuse a seat to any student
who has been accepted through the lottery system, even based on the student’s special
education needs. The Magnet School does not have a BCBA on staff. The Magnet
School Closes for summer vacation and staff is not available. The special education
teacher had recommended a meeting the week before the beginning of classes.
(Testimony of Magnet School Principal (MSP), Testimony of SETMS)

At the beginning 0fthe 2009—2010 school year, the staff of the Magnet School
attempted to set up a meeting with the Parent, but were having difﬁculty receiving a
response from the father. (P-104 pgst 70—94, Testimony of SETMS).

The Magnet School maintained a communication note book for the Student; entries
were made on a daily basis with notes about the Student’s homework and any issues
he might have had in school. The communications book showed that the Student was
having problems with the homework that was assigned. The Parent utilized the note
book to communicate with the Board. The Board and the Magnet School
communicated by email extensively with the Parent. (P—106, P-107, P—108, P-109, P-
110, P—103, P-103A, P-104 P-IOS, Testimony of Father)

The student starts his school day at the Magnet school in skills class, The skills class
had been recommended by the special education teacher rather than an elective. The
Student then checks his homework, does math fluency and ﬁlls an agenda. The para—
professional is with the Student at all times. The tudent does not perform at his grade
level. The Student is provided with modiﬁcations. The modiﬁcations in his program
are (1) in the amount of homework the Student gets, (2) use of a graphic scheduler,
(3) modiﬁed grades based on IEP, (4) preferential seating, (5) multisensory approach
for learning, (6) highlight key words, (7) modiﬁed worksheets and (8) use of
manipulatives. (P—104a pg 11, P-68, Testimony of SETMS).

The Student attended physical therapy sessions at the Connecticut Children’s Medical
Center (CENTER), The Student was discharged from the Center on August 14, 2009
because the Student failed to show for physical therapy, occupational therapy and
speech and language therapeutic sessions. The Center attempted to contact the Parent
by mail and telephone but there was no response. On or about April 2, 2010, the
Student started to again receive again occupational therapy and speech and language
therapy sessions in the Center. (P-113, P—l 16)

The Student was being treated at Saint Francis Behavioral Health Group (SFBHG)
since March 5, 2009. SFBHG was addressing the concerns of the Father in the
Student’s safety, inappropriate behavior and lack of social skills. (8—121)

During the 2009—2010 school year the Parent raised his concern about the Student
soiling his pants. The Parent would send addition clothes in the Student’s locker.
There was no goal or object to address this issue. (Testimony of SETMS)

During the 2009-2010 school year, The Student required many hours of direct
instruction; in order to provide him with more direct instructions the Student’s
program needed to be adj usted. At the beginning of the Student’s attendance at the
Magnet School there was no problem with his behavior. Beginning in January 2010,
the Student had been removed from class because of disruptive behavior that impeded
his learning and also affected his peers. The Student was calling out and giggling out
loud. In his “tempus legend” pant of his class, the Student’s passive behavior in not
responding and not reading was affecting his grade There was a decline in the
Student’s production during the 2009—2010 school year. The Student was being
removed from class to be refocused. (Testimony of SETMS, P-105 pg 21, P-87)

The speech and language pathologist i'epOlted that the Student was successful in his
goals from October 2009 to January 2010. The progress repott for his communication
goals showed that the Student was making satisfactOIy progress in the November
2009 progress report but in his February progress report his progress was
unsatisfactory. The Student’s behavior was affecting his progress. A Functional
Communication Proﬁle—Revised was completed in order to determine the Student’s
areas of need. The repon demonstrated that the Student required sensory/motor
services, had a poor attention span, was easily distractible, impulsive and needed
prompting to cooperate. He had poor receptive and expressive language skills, poor
conversational skills and difﬁculty with abstract, ﬁgurative and non-literal language.
The Student’s articulation was adequate for communication purposes. The pathologist
continued the same goals for the 2010-2011 school year because of the Student’s
behavior. (Testimony of Magnet School SfL Pathologist, MS 4, P-77a)

The father raised the concern that there was no Behavior Plan for the Student. A
BCBA was not retained by the Board 01' by the Magnet school to manage the
Student’s behavior. The Student’s SETMS wrote a behavior plan in May 2010. The
Behavior Plan was not discussed at the PPT nor did it receive the approval of the

Parent. A Functional Behavior Assessment was not performed before the Behavior
Plan was written. (Testimony of Parent, Testimony of SETMS)

During the 2009—2010 school year, the Student was seen by the Magnet School social
worker in a small group. The Student’s range of interests is narrow and he tends to
persewerate on certain things. In the latter part of the 2009-2010 school year the
Student was more distracted, had some unusual behaviors and produced less class
work. The Parent was concerned that the academic program was too strong for the
Student. The Parent was advised that the broad exposure was good for the Student
and he was growing socially and academically. By the end of the school year the
program was not working for the Student. The Student’s social/behavioral goal was
implemented and assessed but progress was not noted. (Testimony of Social Worker,
MS-3 pg 1, P—56 pg 24)

A PPT was held on February 25, 2010 to review the testing that was done by the
Magnet School. The IEP contained eight goals and provided for continuation ofa 1 :1
para-professional, occupational therapy consultation .25 hours per month, 1.5 hours
per week of speech and language therapy, and .5 hours per week of counseling. The
Parent requested an independent evaluation (I.E.E.) 0f the Student which was denied
by the PPT. The evaluation was denied because the Student was progressing and an
I.E.E. had been performed in June 2008. (P—77)

The February 25, 2010 PPT contained the Goals and Objectives for the Student’s
2010—201 1 school year. In Goal 1 the Student was making less than satisfactory
progress. In Goal 2 the nine objectives demonstrate either “0G” (ongoing), or “0”
(making progress). In Goal 4, 3 0f the objectives are rated as “OG”. In Goal 5 in the
latter part of the school year, the Student’s progress went from satisfactory to
unsatisfactory; progress on Goal 6 was not reported. In the IEP of 2009—2010 none of
the objectives were mastered and the Student was only making satisfactory progress
on 3 objectives.(P—76, P-77A)

In the Goals and objectives for the 2010—201 1 school year, Goal 1 contained eight
objectives all of which were repetitive ofthe prior school year; in addition, for
objective 1 0f Goal 1b and objective 1 0f Goal 10 this is the 3'd year they are included
in the Student’s IEP. Goal 2 contained seven objectives all of which were repetitive
0fthe prior year; for objectives 1, 2 and 3 0f Goal 2b and objective 1 0f Goal 20, this
is the 3Id year in the Student’s IEP. Goal 3 was reduced from 9 objectives to 3 with
objectives 2 and 3 having been in the 2009—2010 IEP. Goal 4 contained 6 objectives
all of which were repetitive 0f the prior year with objectives 1 and 2 0f Goal 4a
having been in the Student’s 2008-2009 IEP. Goal 6 is the same as Goal 5 ofthe
2009—2010 IEP and the objectives are repetitive. Goal 7 is the same as Goal 6 in the
2009~2010 IEP and the objectives are repetitive with an unclear percentage for
mastering. (In objective 1 it states 64% but in the evaluation column it can be
mastered with 80%; objective 2 states 54% but in the evaluation column it can be
mastered with 80%). Goal 8 is the same as the USPS in the two prior years but the
objectives are different. (P—77, P-56, P-36)

The progress repoﬁed for the period February 25, 2010 through June 2010 of the
2009-2010 IEP showed that of the 43 Goals and objectives, satisfactory progress (S or
8+) was reponed on 21 objectives in April 2010 and unsatisfactory progress was
repOited on 6 objectives and 1 Goal. Progress was assessed as “O” on Goal 2c,
objective 1 (“0” deﬁned as “making progress-will continue to require
reinforcement”) (P-84, p. 6); Goal 4a, objective 3 (“0” deﬁned as “ongoing); and
Goal 5, objective 3 (“0” deﬁned as “making progress”). In June 2010 no progress
(“N”) was repotted on 5 objectives. (P—77, P-84; MS 3 & MS 5)

An Occupational Therapy Assessment was performed on March 29, 2010, by the
CENTER. They found that the Student presented with signiﬁcantly below average
ﬁne motor skills overall and sensoty processing concerns affecting self—care
independence. He demonstrated below average bilateral grip strength. The Student
needed direct involvement of an OT to work on his severe deﬁcits. The Student
demonstrated poor seIf-care independence for his age, palticularly in the areas of self-
dressing and grooming/hygiene, The CENTER’s plan included having the Student
write 4 sentences with good legibility and that he complete toilet hygiene with
supervision and verbal cues. (Testimony of CCMC evaluator, P—l 16)

On 01‘ about September 13, 2010, Dr. Erik Mayville completed a Psycho—educational
evaluation of the Student. The Parent had requested an independent evaluation of the
Student’s educational and treatment needs. The Doctor reviewed the behavior Plan
prepared by the SETMS and he noted that data collection procedures were not
described, that procedures for the Student to win points back were not described, and
that strategies were listed in vague terms. (Testimony Dr. Mayville)

Dr. Mayville performed the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form and had it ﬁlled
Out by the special education teacher and the Parent. Both raters found problems with
the Student’s ability to concentrate, stubbornness, distractibility, overly sensitive,
repeats words and sounds over again and is overactive. The Doctor was of the opinion
that these issues needed to be addressed in a Behavior Management Plan (BMP).
(Testimony of Dr. Mayville, P-96)

The Student’s adaptive behavior was evaluated by Dr. Mayville using the Vineland
Adaptive Behavior Scales, 2"“l Edition. The assessment looks at communication, daily
living and social skills in the home and community environment. In all 3 areas the
student scored low; his adaptive Behavior Composite score was 44. He scored higher
than less than 1% of similarly aged peers. In his daily living skills he showed
weaknesses in informing people when he was soiled, putting things away, brushing
his teeth independently, holding eating utensils correctly and a lack ofeaution. In his
socialization he demonstrated weaknesses in showing affection to familiar people,
playing with others, bullying other kids, and not sharing toys or possessions. The
evaluator found that his current adaptive function suppoﬂed a diagnosis of Mild
Mental Retardation. During his two observations the evaluator did not see the Student
engaged, he had problems being focused and there was a lack of peer interaction. In

13

August 2, 201 1 Final Decision and Order 1 10154

his Latin class, the evaluator saw that the student had problems with English and
keeping on task. In his computer class the Student had to ﬁll out a general suwey and
this was problematic for the Student. (Testimony of Dr. Mayville, P—96)

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:

1.

The New Britain and Haitford Boards of Education have the burden of proving
the appropriateness of the child‘s program or placement, which burden must be
met by a preponderance of the evidence. Conn. Reg. § 10-76h—14(a); Pt ex rel.

Mr. P. v. Newington Bd 0fEduc., 512 F.Supp.2d 89, 99 (D.C0nn. 2007).

It is undisputed that the Student is entitled to receive special education and related
services to obtain a free and appropriate public education (FAPE). Under the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C.
§1401 et. seq, FAPE is deﬁned as special education and related services that are
provided at public expense, meet the standards of the state educational agency,
include an appropriate school education, and are provided in conformity with the
IEP. 20 U.StC. §1401(8),

The proposed program or placement must be reviewed in light of the information
available to the PPT at the time the IEPs were developed. B. L. v. New Britain Ba’.
QfEduc., 394 F. Supp. 2d 522, 537 (D. Conn. 2005).

There is minimal express statutory authority concerning special education
students enrolled in magnet schools. Section 10-264l(h) C.G.S, provides that: In
the case of a student identiﬁed as requiring special education the school district in
which the student resides shall: (1) Hold the planning and placement team
meeting for such student and shall invite representatives from the interdistrict
magnet school to participate in such meeting; and (2) pay the interdistrict magnet
school an amount equal to the difference between the reasonable cost of educating
such student and the sum of the amount received by the interdistrict magnet
school for such student pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and amounts
received from other state, federal, local or private sources calculated on a per
pupil basis. If a student requiring special education attends an interdistrict magnet
school on a full-time basis, such intel‘district magnet school shall be responsible
for ensuring that such student receives the services mandated by the student’s
individualized education program, whether such services are provided by the
intex‘district magnet school or by the school district in which the student resides.

The Connecticut Commissioner of Education’s November 1, 2002 Circular Letter
C—17, sets forth a variety of requirements for interdistrict magnet schools,
including for Special Education: All students are eligible to attend interdistrict
magnet schools and the expectation is that all students will be included, regardless
of any disability. Every effort must be made to accommodate and program for

14

August 2, 2011 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0154

special education students. Only in the rare event that a student could not achieve
satisfactorily even with the use of supplementary aids and services in the
education environment could it be found that placement in an interdistrict magnet
school to be inappropriate.

6. Neither the statute nor Circular Letter—17 needs to explain the role of the PPT.
IDEIA clearly deﬁnes the role of the PPT. Neither the statute nor the Circular
letter diminish or reduce the responsibility of the authority of the planning and
placement team. Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (RCSA) §10-
76a(1)(15) deﬁnes, “Planning and placement team” means a group of certiﬁed or
licensed professionals, who represent each of the teaching, administrative and
pupil personnel staffs and who participate equally in the decision making process
to determine the speciﬁc educational needs of the child and develop an
individualized educational program for the child. These shall be persons
knowledgeable in the areas necessary to determine and review the appropriate
educational program for an exceptional child. (Emphasis added). The Magnet
School and the Board try to diminish the responsibility of their staff at the PPT to
only, “for implementing the IEP once it is adopted”. (Magnet School Post Trial
Brief p. 10) or “ [the]only responsibilities [of the Board] were to convene PPT
meetings and invite representatives from [the Magnet School] to such meetings
and to pay [the Magnet School] the appropriate amount due it”, (Board’s Post
Trial Brief p. 10). IDEIA clearly gives more authority to the PPT members.
R.C.S.A. § 1076a(1)(5). As equal members either the Board 01‘ the Magnet School
could have objected to the Student’s program or placement. There were no
statements or objections noted on the recommendations or summary page of the
IEP that either the Board 01' the Magnet School were in disagreement with the
Student’s goals and objectives, related services or the Student’s program or
placement at the Magnet School during the 2009—2010 01‘2010—201 1 school years.

7. Under the Supreme Court test established by Board of Education v. Rowley, 458
US. 176, 203 (1982), F APE consists of educational instruction speciﬁcally
designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child, and related sewices
as are necessary to permit the child to beneﬁt from the instruction. FAPE is not
required to maximize the potential of each child; however, it must be sufﬁcient to
confer educational beneﬁt. Id. at 200. The Rowley standard is satisﬁed by
providing meaningful access to educational opportunities for the disabled child.
Id. at 192. The Rowley court determined that the IDEA requires school districts to
provide a "basic ﬂoor of opportunity" consisting of "access to specialized
instruction and related services which are individually designed to provide
educational beneﬁt to the handicapped child." 10’. at 201. The Supreme Coutt
found Congress' intent in passing the IDEA was ”more to open the door of public
education to handicapped children on appropriate terms than to guarantee any
particular level of education once inside." 1d. at 192.

8. However, the Rowley requirement ot‘consideration of the unique needs of the
handicapped child does require consideration of the child's capacity to learn. Nein

10.

v, Greater Clark County School Corporation, 95 F.Supp.2d 961, 973 (SD. 1nd.
2000). The requirement of "some educational benefit" requires more than a
"trivial" beneﬁt but not a maximization of the potential of a handicapped child.
NJ. v. Northwest R-I School District, 2005 US. Dist. LEXIS 24673, 22 (ED.
Mo, 2005).

Under Rowley, there are two components to the FAPE analysis, one procedural
and the other substantive. An educational program can be set aside for failure to
provide FAPE on procedural grounds under three circumstances: (1) where the
procedural inadequacies have "compromised the pupil's right to an appropriate
education"; (2) when the district‘s conduct has "seriously hampered the parents’
opportunity to paltieipate in the formulation process"; or (3) when the procedural
failure has resulted in "a deprivation of educational beneﬁts.” Independent School
District No. 283 v. SD, 88 F.3d at 556. Where this type of harm is found, the
substantive question of whether the IEP provided FAPE is not addressed by the
hearing panel. W.B. vi Target Range School District, 960 F.2d 1479, 1485 (9th
Cir. 1991). Assuming no denial of FAPE on procedural grounds, the analysis
turns to the substance of whether the IEP provides FAPE as deﬁned by the
Rowley standard and "whether a proposed IEP is adequate and appropriate for a
particular child at a given point in time." Rowley, 458 U.S. at 200; Town of
Burlington v. Dept. ofEducation, 736 F.2d 773, 788 (1st Cir. 1984), aff’d 471
US. 359 (1985).

The parent alleges amongst other procedural Violations that the absence of the
special education teacher during the March 19, 2009 PPT makes the IEP
inadequate. In A.H. on behalf of J .H. V. Dept. of Educ. of the City of New York,
1 10 LRP 47104(2nd Cir. 2010), the coutt found that the absence of the special
education teacher, “did not render the IEP inadequate. See Grim v. Rhinebeck
Cent, Sch. Dist, 346 F.3d 377, 381-82 (2d Cir. 2003) (holding that not every
procedural error in development of IEP renders that p1an legally inadequate).
Relief is warranted only if we conclude based on our independent review of the
record, that the error denied 11-1. a free appropriate public education. See J.D. ex
rel. JD. v. Pawlel Sch. Dist, 224 F.3d 60, 69 (2d Cir. 2000). IDEA instwcts that
such a conclusion is warranted only where the procedural deﬁciencies (1)
"impeded the child's right to a free appropriate public education," (2)
"signiﬁcantly impeded the parents' oppottunity to paiticipate in the decision
making process regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education," or
(3) "caused a deprivation of educational benefits." 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(E)(ii).
None ot‘these criteria is met here. The Special Education teacher had met prior to
the meeting with the team and had written the goals that were to be presented and
decided at the PPT. School staff who worked with the Student was present. The
school psychologist was present as were the regular education teacher, the para—
professional who worked with the Student and the OT and speech and language
pathologist. The Parent was also present and did not object to the special
education teacher not being present and did not object to a follow up PPT to
review Dr. Mayville’s evaluation.

16

August 2, 2011 Final Decision and Order 11—0154

1 1. At the February 25, 2010 the Board denied the Parent’s request for an

12.

independent educational evaluation. IDEIA is very clear: “Parents have the right
to an independent evaluation at public expense if the parents disagree with an
evaluation obtained by the board of education. However, the board of education
may initiate a due process hearing conducted pursuant to Section 10-76h—1 of
these regulations to show that its evaluation is appropriate. R.C.S.A. §10-76d-
9(c)(2), The PPT did not follow this procedure. The Social Worker testified that
he did not mark the progress that the Student had made during the 2009—20 1 0
school year in his social/behavior goal. The Magnet School failed to assess
progress on this goal thereby impeding the Parent from making an informed
decision about his son’s program and placement.

The Boards interfered with the Parent’s right to fully participate in PPT decisions
by failing to call a PPT meeting when it became clear to the Magnet School that
the services added by the July 20, 2009 Amendment to the IEP would not be
implemented. Given the level of maladaptive behavior, the proper course was for
the Magnet School to notify the Board of the need for a PPT meeting and for the
Board to convene a PPT so that the requirement that a skilled behavioral specialist
be used in conjunction with the Student’s program as was added by the July 20,
2009 Amendment, but not implemented at the Magnet School. The Magnet
School and the Board were responsible for this signiﬁcant violation because
although the requirement was not implemented by the Magnet School staff, both
Boards failed to request a PPT meeting to discuss this deﬁciency and target the
Student’s unique needs. Neither Board failed to consider and implement an FBA
and a behavior plan even though the Student’s behavior clearly worsened during
the 2009—20] 0 school year and interfered with his education. The Boards never
called a PPT to discuss developing a behavior plan until the PPT meeting on May
21, 2010, four months after the teaching staff concluded that the Student’s
behavior was impeding his education. When a behavior plan was ﬁnally created,
it was inadequate. The Behavior Management Plan created by the SETMS was
inadequate because it failed to obtain any parental input 01', at a minimum,
provide for a review of the Plan by the Parent to ensure that all the Student’s
behaviors were being addressed even though the Parent was given certain
obligations in the Behavior Management Plan. An IEP is an educational package
that must target all ofa student's unique educational needs, whether academic or
non-academic. (Lelm v. Portland School Committee (lst C111 1993) 998 F.2d
1083, 1089.) The term "unique educational needs" is to be broadly construed and
includes the student‘s academic, social, emotional, communicative, physical, and
vocational needs. (Seattle Sch. Dist. N0. 1 v. BS, 82 F.3d 1493, 1500 (9th Cir.
1996) [citing J.R. Rep. No, 410, 1983 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2088, 2106].) The Student’s
lack of progress and the downward spiral in his behavior resulted in a denial of
FAPE to the Student during the 2009—2010 school year. This was clearly noted by
the staff during the 2009-2010 school year. (Findings of Fact 35, 39, 42, 44 and
46). The 2009-2010 school year program provided by the Magnet School and the
Board was not appropriate and denied the Student FAPE.

16.

The Magnet School and the Board violated the Parent’s IDEIA procedural rights
relating to the 2010-201 1 school year in several respects. They failed to have the
PPT determine whether the Magnet School had an appropriate program for the
Student. The Student’s lack of educational progress warrants a look at whether the
placement at the Magnet School is appropriate. The Magnet School argues that
they have no authority to remove the Student from the Magnet school. The
Magnet School Principal might be correct except that as a member of the
Student’s PPT, the Magnet School as an “equal” member of the PPT is charged
with providing an appropriate program for the Student. The Commissioner of
Education in Circular Letter 17 understood that not all special education students
would achieve satisfactory progress in the magnet schools. Wisely the Circular
letter states, “Only in the rare event that a student could not achieve satisfactorily
even with the use of supplementary aids and services in the education
environment could it be found that placement in an interdistrict magnet school to
be inappropriate.” Clearly the “rare event” has arrived for the Student and both
the Board and the Magnet School failed to recognize the Student’s downward
spiral and have, for the 2010—201 1 school year, continued the placement of the
Student at the Magnet School. The Parent does not escape from the blame; he
could have withdrawn the Student from the Magnet school. But the Board and the
Magnet School did not have to continue a placement that is not providing the
Student with minimal beneﬁt. As the Parent has done, they could have ﬁled for
due process and challenged the requested placement of the Student as not
providing FAPE in the LRE. Although parental preferences must be taken into
consideration in deciding IEP goals and objectives and making placement
decisions, the IDEA ”does not require a school district to provide a child with the
speciﬁc educational placement that her parents prefer." Blackman v, Springfield
R—Xll School District, 198 F.3d 648, 658 (8th Cir. 1999); TF. v. Special School
District, 449 F.3d 816, 821 (8th Cir. 2006). The issue is whether the school
district's placement is appropriate, "not whether another placement would also be
appropriate, 01' even better for that matter." Heather S. V. Wisconsin. 125 F .3d
1045, 1057 (7th Cir. 1997). The program offered by the Magnet School and the
Board for the 2010~201 1 school year is not appropriate and will not provide the
Student with FAPE in the LRE.

The Parent’s requested placement at Connecticut Center for Child Development
(CCCD) is not appropriate as the Parent has not provided evidence of a program
at CCCD would provide the Student with FAPE in the LRE.

The program provided by the Board for the 2008-2009 school year was
appropriate and provided the Student with FAPE in the LRE. The evidence
presented showed that the Student made progress during that year and any
procedural violations did not rise to the level of a denial ofFAPE. (Findings of
Facts #15,l6, 19, 20 & 22)

There was insufficient evidence to show that the Student would beneﬁt from an
in—home program coordinated by a BCBA.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

1.

The program provided by the Board for the 2008-2009 school year was
appropriate and provided the Student with FAPE in the LRE.

The program provided by the Board and the Magnet School for the 2009—201 0
school year was not appropriate and did not provide the Student with FAPE in the
LRE.

The program offered by the Board and the Magnet School for the 2010-201 1
school year was not appropriate and would not provide the student with FAPE in
the LRE.

The program at CCCD is not appropriate.

There was insufﬁcient evidence to show that the Student would beneﬁt from an
in-home program coordinated by a BCBA.

The Board shall provide independent occupational therapy and physical therapy
evaluations of the Student. These evaluations shall be done by Connecticut
Children Medical Center staff and their recommendations incorporated in the
Student‘s IEP.

The Board shall hold a planning and placement team meeting within two weeks of
the mailing of the decision.
a. The Board shall invite Dr. Erik Mayville t0 the PPT and Dr. Mayville
shall consult with the PPT in developing and implementing an appropriate
special education program for the Student. If Dr. Mayville is not available
the Institute for Professional Practice will be an adequate replacement.
b. The program will be at the Board’s Middle School.
c, The program shall include a BCBA that shall work with the Student 5
hours per week. The BCBA shall do a functional behavior assessment of
the Student and write a behavior management plan for the Student.

8. The Student is entitled to 90 school days of compensatory education in the form
of aﬁer school speech and language therapy with a private speech and language
pathologist chosen by the Board and the Magnet School for 2 hours each school
day or 180 hours. The compensatory education shall be provided according to a
schedule developed by the speech and language pathologist in consultation with
the Parent. The compensatOIy education shall be provided during the 201 1—2012
school year. The cost shall be divided equally by the Board and the Magnet
School. The Board and the Magnet School shall provide transportation to and
from the speech and language pathologist they have chosen. This compensatory
education is for the denia1 of FAPE during the 2009-2010 school year for which
both the Board and the Magnet School were responsible. 1f the Board and the
Magnet school cannot agree on a pathologist, the Parent shall choose the
pathologist and the Board and the Magnet School shall pay for transportation up
to a 40 mile round trip limit.

9. The Board shall reimburse the Parent only for the IEE evaluation performed by
Dr. Mayville on or about September 13, 2010 to the extent that the Parent
incurred out of pocket expenses. The Parent shall provide the Board with a copy
of the receipt or the cancelled check for his out of pocket payment.

10. The Board does not have to reimburse the Parent for the therapeutic sewices
