PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY
: 
 
 
On March 7, 2017, the Parents received a request for a special education due process hearing 
filed by the Board. On March 8, 2017, the Connecticut State Department of Education assigned 
the undersigned Hearing Officer to preside over the case. On March 28,
 
2017, a Notice of 
Prehearing Conference was sent to Attorney Michael Gilberg, who was representing Parents, and 
to Attorney Christine Sullivan who was representing the Board, with a proposed prehearing 
conference date of March 31, 2017. In recognition of 
the fast approaching deadline for mailing 
the final decision and order, which was established as April 21, 2017, the Hearing Officer 
offered April 17, 2017 and April 18, 2017 as potential hearing dates for consideration in an email 
accompanying the

she was not available for a prehearing conference on March 31, 2017 and would coordinate with 
the Attorney for the Parents to find a mutually agreed upon alternative. Later that day, Atto

for the Parents confirmed he would work with Attorney for the Board to find a replacement time 
for the prehearing conference. In response to an inquiry from the Hearing Officer, both Counsel

previously offered. 
When no agreed 
upon dates had been tendered by April 6, 2017, the Hearing Officer reminded Counsel of the 
pending mailing deadline in the matter and indicated she would be available from 8:30 a.m. to 
5:00 p.m. on April 7, 2017 for the 
prehearing conference. The Attorney for the Board indicated 
she could be available at 8:30 a.m. or 4:30 p.m. for a prehearing conference. Attorney for the 
Parents indicated he would not be available. The Hearing Officer then gave the Attorney for the 
Paren
ts until 5:00 p.m. to consult with his clients and determine whether he and/or they objected 
to the hearing dates of May 16, 2017 and May 23, 2017 and, if so, to provide the basis for such
