PROCEDURAL HISTORY: The Parents&#8482; attorney requested this hearing by mailing a request dated April 30, 2010 for a due 
process hearing to the State Department of Education ("SDE") and copies to the Board and its attorney.  The Board received the request on May 3, 2010.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on May 5, 2010. On May 18, 2010, a prehearing conference was held. Th
e parties&#8482; attorneys reported that mediation was 
scheduled on June 9, 2010.  The mailing date for the fi
nal decision was set at July 19, 2010.  Hearing dates 
were agreed on for June 24, 2010 and June 30, 2010. On June 21, 2010, the SDE advised the Hearing 

Officer that the parties reached an agreement at mediati
on and that the Parents&#8482; atto
rney would advise her of the status of the due process request.  On June 23, 2010, 
the Parents&#8482; attorney reported that the parties had settled the matter, but had not executed a written ag
reement.  She withdrew th
e hearing request without prejudice and stated that the case would be withdrawn 
with prejudice after an agreement was executed.  The 
hearing convened on June 24, 2010. The parties&#8482; atto
rneys and the Parents did 
not attend.  The Board&#8482;s Supervisor of Special Education was present.  The Hearing Officer ruled 
that the case would be dismissed. 
The Parents&#8482; attorney was allowed until
 July 8, 2010 to request that the hearing be dismissed with prejudice. 
If the request was not filed by July 8, 2010, the case would be dismissed without a 
specification of with or without prejudice. On June 29, 2010, the Hearing Officer 
sent a letter to the parties&#8482; attorneys confirming 
the June 24, 2010 order. No request was filed. FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: 
It is ordered that this 
case shall be dismissed.
