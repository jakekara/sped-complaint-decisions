FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

Shall the Hearing Ofﬁcer order a psychiatric evaluation of the Student by an evaluator selected
by the Board?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This hearing was requested by the Board on November 7, 2012. The Hearing Ofﬁcer was
appointed on November 9, 2012. The date for mailing the decision was initially set at January
21, 2012: however, since this hearing was requested by the Board and no conciliation period is
required, the correct decision date was December 20, 2012.

At the pre-hearing conference on November 26, 2012, it was repotted that mediation was being
considered. On November 29, 2012, the Board requested an extension of the decision date to
accommodate settlement negotiations. The Hearing Ofﬁcer extended the decision date to

January 19, 2013.
SUMMARY:

The Board requested the hearing because the Parents had resisted the Board’s request for a
psychiatric evaluation of the Student, who had been absent from school for a signiﬁcant period

of time.
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

Because the Parties have resolved their differences and the Board has withdrawn its reque§t for a
hearing, this matter is DISMISSED.
