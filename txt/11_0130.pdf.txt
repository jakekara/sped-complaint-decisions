FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

independent Speech/Language evaluation. The Board’s issues are as follows:

staff appropriate?

2. If not, is the Mother entitled to an independent Speech/Language evaluation at Board
expense?

The Mother’s issue is as follows:

3. Was Student properly exited from special education services for 2010-201 1?

PRO CEDURAL HISTORY:

This hearing was requested by the Board on September 22, 2010. The Hearing Ofﬁcer
was appointed on September 23, 2010. The date for mailing the decision was December
6, 2010.

March 7,2011 ~2— Final Decision and Order 11-0130

A pre-hearing conference was held on October 6, 2010. The hearing was scheduled for
November 2 and 12, 2010. The Board notiﬁed the Hearing Ofﬁcer on October 19 that
the Parties had agreed to request mediation, which was scheduled for November 12,
2010. The Patties requested an extension of the decision date to accommodate settlement
negotiations, and the Hearing Ofﬁcer granted that request and extended the decision date
from December 6, 2010, to January 5, 2011. The Hearing Ofﬁcer cancelled the
November hearing dates and told the Parties she would hold another pi'e-hearing
conference if mediation was not successful.

Mediation was not successful and another pre-hearing conference was held on November
29, 2010. At that time, the hearing was scheduled for December 23, 2010 and Januaiy 24
and 27, 2011, and the Parties requested an extension of the decision date to accommodate
the additional hearing dates. The Hearing Ofﬁcer granted that request and extended the
decision date from January 5 to February 4, 201 1.

On December 22, 2010, the Parent contacted the Hearing Ofﬁcer, reporting that she was
ill and would not be able to appear on December 23, 2010. The Hearing Ofﬁcer
cancelled the December 23 hearing date.

When the hearing convened on January 24, 2011 the Board noted for the record that the
Parent had submitted no exhibits and no witness list. The Board presented its case
concerning the refusal to fund an independent evaluation. As summarized in an Interim
Order dated January 25, 2011, the Parents acknowledged that they had secured an
independent evaluation at the SCSU Communication Clinic. The Board’s Director of
Special Education had not seen the report of this evaluation. After discussion, the Parent
agreed to bring the evaluation repott to the Board’s Director of Special Education and the
Parties agreed to hold a Planning and Placement Team meeting to discuss this evaluation.
The Board withdrew its request for a hearing after the Parent agreed to withdraw the
request for an independent evaluation.

The Healing Ofﬁcer postponed the scheduled January 27, 2011, hearing session. A
hearing session was scheduled for March 2, 2011, to address the Parent’s issue
concerning the Board’s ﬁnding that the Student was no longer in need of special
education.

On March 1, 201 1, the Hearing Ofﬁcer received a Motion to Dismiss from the Board and
a telephone message from the Parent that her other child was sick and she would be
unable to attend the hearing on March 2, 201 1. The Hearing Ofﬁcer postponed the
March 2, 2011, hearing session and suggested dates of March 7, 14, 15, 16 or17. She
also requested the Parties to request an extension of the decision date of March 6, 2011.

The Patties were unable to agree on a date to resume the hearing and no request for an
extension of the decision date was received.
