September 16, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13~0452

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student is not identiﬁed as a student requiring special education and related services and is
not entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Improvement Act
(IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et seq.

A1 a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Board refused to identify the Student as
requiring special education and related services. The Parents objected to the denial.

On May 3, 2013, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The patties
agreed to forgo a resolution meeting and mediate the matter.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on May 3, 2013 and pre—hearing conferences were
held on May 20, 2013 and July 8, 2013. Hearing dates of July 15 and 16, 2013 were chosen by

the parties

The hearing dates 01‘July 15 and 16, 2013 were cancelled to allow time for the parties to mediate
the matter. Hearing dates ofAugust 26, 27 and 29 and September 16, 2013 were chosen. At the
August 26, 2013 hearing, the parties advised the hearing ofﬁcer that they were able to resolve the
matter but needed additional time to allow the Student to review and sign the agreement. During
the course of the hearing the Student turned eighteen years old and gave consent for the matter to
continue. The August 27 and 29, 2013 hearing dates were cancelled.

On September 12, 2013, the Parents’ attorney informed the hearing ofﬁcer that the Student had
ratiﬁed the agreement and withdrew the matter with prejudice.

The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the
palties’ mediation and the hearing dates. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is
September 20, 2013,
