Bonnie Arm F. v. Callallen Independent School Board, 835 F.Supp. 340 (SD. Tex. 1993)

October 4, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0363

The Student is identiﬁed as a student who has a disability and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public
education (“FAPE”) as defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (“IDEA”) 20
United States Code (“ U.S.C.”) §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute (“C.G.S.”) §10-76a. The Student
is eligible to receive special education services as a student with a Speciﬁc Learning Disability.

The Parents allege that starting in the Student’s 7m Grade, the Student was subjected to bullying behaviors at the
hands of her peers. This was known by the School, who exerted minimal effott to rectify the situation. The
Student’s grades began to deteriorate, t0 the point of failure, In addition, Parents feel the Student was not
properly evaluated to determine the full extent and impact of any disabilities 0f the Student and as a result the
Board failed to provide the Student with an appropriate program and resulting services, denying the Student
FAPE for the 2010-2011 and 201 1-2012 academic years.

The Board denies that the Student was subjected to any bullying behaviors, that the evaluations that were
completed were appropriate and that if there were evaluations that were not completed it was because the Parent
either refused to allow the evaluation or failed to notify the Board of a need to conduct such evaluations. The
Student’s failure to attend school and the Parents’ failure to make the Student attend, are seen as the primary
cause of any failing grades and that the program and services offered to the Student were appropriate at all

times.

The Student ceased attending school, in May of the 2010-2011 school years. This followed her arrest allegedly
assaulting a teacher. A Planning and Placement Team meeting (“PPT”) was held on 6/ 10/1 1. The Parents
requested an out of district placement for the remainder of the school year; the request was denied.

The Parents sought an independent neuropsychological evaluation of the Student, which was conducted over the
months of February, August and September 201 l. A PPT was held on 11/29/ 1 1 to review the evaluation. The
Parents were informed that the PPT team did not believe that the Student had ever been bullied and that almost
all of the recommendations requested by the evaluation were already part of the Student’s IEP. The Team
added Social work services. The Parents requested placement at an out—of—district therapeutic day program
along with compensatory services for two years. The request was denied by the PPT Team, allegedly without
consideration or discussion with the Parents.

The IEP for the 2012—2013 academic year was created at a 6/26/12 PPT. Programming and services for the
Student remained the same as the programs and services offered in the 6/10/1 1 and 6/7/ 10 IEPs. The Parents
again requested an out—of—district placement as well as compensatory education services, which was again
denied by the Board.

The Student remains out of school at this point in time

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to C.G.S. §10-76h and related regulations; 20 U.S.C.
§1415(D and related regulations, and in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act

(“U.A.P.A.”); C.G.S. §§ 4-176e t0 4—178inclusive, and 4—181a and 4—186.

The Parents ﬁled the request for a Due Process Hearing on or about 4/5/12. A pre-hearing conference was held
on 4/26/12, in which the parties identiﬁed the issues for a due process hearing. The parties agreed to seek the
services of a mediator in an attempt to resolve the matter.

2

October 4, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12—0363

Subsequently, on 4/26/12, Counsel for the Parents requested and was granted a thirty (30) day extension of the
resolution period to allow for the mediation that was tentatively scheduled for 4/30/12. The Board was not

opposed to such an extension.

Initial hearing dates were set for 6/ 14/ 12, 6/ 15/ 12, and 6/26/12. Mediation was held but proved to be
unsuccessful in resolving the issues at hand.

Hearings were held and testimony taken on 6/ 14/ 12, 6/ 1 5/ 12, and 6/26/12, with additional hearing dates
requested by the parties. 7/17/12, 7/3 1/ 12, 8/ 1 3/ 12, and 8/14/12 were selected by the parties as additional dates.

On 6/ 14/12 the Parents ﬁled an Emergency Motion for Relief, requesting an order that the Board send referrals
to therapeutic schools on behalf of the Student. The palties reached agreement on the Emergency Motion on
their own accord prior to the motion being heard.

On 7/17/12 the hearing convened, with the palties immediately requesting that the hearing be postponed as the
parties felt that they were close to settlement and did not want to incur additional expenses on the part of their
clients by having a full day of hearing. The hearing was closed on 7/ 17/12, with no fulther testimony being
taken in relation to the complaint. The additional date of 7/3 1/ 12 was to remain available should the parties not
reach settlement.

The Hearing Ofﬁcer was subsequently notiﬁed by counsel for the Parents that settlement was not going to be
reached and that additional dates for hearing would probably be needed. The Due Process Hearing reconvened
on 7/3 1/ 12 with testimony taken. The Parents moved, with no objection from the Board, to add the 2012
extended school year program and the 2012-2013 school year to the issues before the Hearing Ofﬁcer. The
request was granted. The parties then requested the additional dates of 8/ 13/ 12, 8/ 14/12 and 9/4/12 for hearing.
Counsel for the Parent then requested in writing, and for good cause shown, an extension of the mailing date for
the ﬁnal decision and order to allow for further settlement discussions. The Board had no objection to the
request for extension. The extension of the mailing date for the ﬁnal decision and order was granted, moving
the mailing date for the ﬁnal decision date to 9/27/12.

Hearings were convened on 8/ 13/ 12 and 8/ 14/ 12; the hearing concluded with both parties resting on 8/ 14/ 12.
The parties agreed that the 9/4/ 12 date would no longer be necessary. Final briefs were ordered to be completed
by close of business on 9/7/ 12. On 9/6/12, the Board requested an extension of one week to 9/ 14/ 1 2, to submit
ﬁnal briefs. The mailing date for the ﬁnal decision and order was moved to 10/4/2012. There was no objection
to the request from the Student and the request was granted.

The Parents presented 45 full exhibits in the hearing. The Board presented 7 full exhibits in the hearing.

October 4, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0363

FINDINGS OF FACT:

1. The Student is a 13 year old female, currently attending Enﬁeld Public Schools in the 8‘'1 gradel, identiﬁed
as a special education student, under the category of Speciﬁc Learning Disability, and found to be eligible to
receive special education and related sewices under the IDEA. (Board—l,l:'arent—14)2

2. The Student resided in Enﬁeld and attended the Enﬁeld Public Schools from the second grade through the
end of the 2011-2012. (Tr. Mother p.18) The Student continues to reside in Enﬁeld. (6/ 13/ 12 Tr.)

3. The Student was described by her mother as stwggling with homework, having difﬁculty making friends
and always by herself. She has issues with trust, has difﬁculties communicating with adults and can be
disrespectful. (Tr. Mother., p.91)

4. The last formal evaluations conducted by the Enﬁeld Public Schools of the Student were completed in June,
20083. (B-2, PPT Meeting Summary, P-8) and presented in a PPT held on 6/19/08 (P—94). The Student’s IQ
scores showed variability. She scored in the average range with the exception of perceptual reasoning
where she scored in the borderline range with a 77. Comments of the evaluator stated that given the
discrepancy, the Student’s language based scores, which were in the average range, should be the best
estimate of her potential. (P-8, p.6) The evaluator found that her weak mental control may impede the
processing of complex information and slow new learning. (Id). The Student was found to have difﬁculty
with perceptual motor competencies, non—Verbal ﬂuid reasoning and with the ability to mentally organize
Visual information. (P—8, pp. 5, 6)

5. According to the evaluation, the Student was having academic difﬁculty in all areas. (Id). While she had
average comprehension, she had not mastered basic reading skills such as the sound/symbol relationships,
and had not mastered basic math facts or basic writing skills such as punctuation and capitalization. (Id.). It
was noted that she read b for d, d for p and p for d, (Id. p. 6) The evaluator reported that Student was
described as demonstrating a positive attitude toward learning, good work habits and study skills, and an
ability to interact with others. (Id. p. 2) Weaknesses were noted by staff in the areas of reading, written
language, spelling, social studies and math. (1d. p. 2) The evaluation encouraged the team to consider
Student’s need for a specialized, guided, sequential, phonetic approach to improve her reading deﬁciencies.
(Id. p. 8-9)

6. The Student and her Parents attended the PPT, with the Student requesting extra help with math and
reading. (P-9 p.2) The PPT indicated that the Student would be provided with 5.83 hours of direct special
education instmction in language arts in the resource room, and ﬁve hours per week of support in math

class. (Id. p.16).

1 As oflhe date ofthe decision, the Student will be entering her ﬁ'eshman year.

2 Hencefotth exhibits for the Board will be denoted with a “B “ and a corresponding number; exhibits for the Parents will be denoted
with a “P" and a corresponding number.

3 Connecticut Mastery Testing was completed on March 3, 2010, the Studentscored at the Below Basic level on Mathematics,
mastering 3 out of 23 strands; Basic level on the Grade 6 Reading test, mastering 1 out of four strands; and Basic level on the Grade 6
Writing test, mastering 0 0f 2 strands. The Vertical Score Results indicated an increase in ability over the previous two testing periods
in both Mathematics and Reading, however in Mathematics the Student never progressed past stage land entered stage 2 in Reading
only on the 2010 testing. In 2010, the School and District average was on stage 4 for both Mathematics and Reading.

4 While this IEP is not a subject of this Due Process Hearing, it is the ﬁrst IEP to incorporate and discuss the last fomal evaluation
conducted by the Board of this Student and so is being presented to provide context to subsequent discussions and ﬁndings.

When the Student entered seventh grade, the Principal of JFKMS held a number of meetings with the
Student’s father and the Student to establish a trusting relationship with them. (Tr. Principal N. p.130)
Principal N. also handpicked the team of teachers who would be working with the Student for the two years
she would be in attendance at JFKMS. (Id. p.130) Principal N. also made himself, rather than a house
master, the supervisor of the Student’s team. (Id. p.130) He did so to provide the family with a single point
of contact, and because he had developed a good relationship with the Student’s father. (Id. pps.131-132)

The IEP for the Student’s seventh grade was developed at a PPT held on 6/7/10. (P-14)

Both Parents attended the PPT meeting at which the IEP for the 2010-201 1 school year was designed. (P-
14, p.1) Principal N. attended the meeting as did staff members. (Id)

The 6/7/ 10 IEP is developed from the previous IEP, dated 6/1/095 . The goals and objectives in math for the
6/7/ 10 IEP are vi1tually identical to the 6/1/09 IEP. (P-14, P-12)

Pursuant to the 2010-2011 IEP, the Student was to receive instruction in collaborative classes in remedial
reading, mathematics, English, social studies, and science. (P-14, p. 2, 24) The Student’s special education
direct sewices in language arts in the resource room were reduced from 5.83 hours per week to 3.75 hours
per week. The in-class math instruction was removed from the IEP. (P-12 p.20, P-14 p. 2, 24)

Collaborative classes involve a certiﬁed special education teacher, in the Student’s case, Special Education
Teacher, providing direct instruction to the Student along with a regular education subject matter teacher.
(Tr. Special Education Teacher p. 36) In the Student’s support class, Special Education Teacher provided
the Student with individual direct instruction. (161.)

At the PPT at which the 2010-11 IEP was developed, staff reported that the Student was passing her classes
and working on grade level. (P- 14, p. 2)

The PPT held on 6/7/10 identiﬁed weaknesses in reading comprehension, phonics, decoding, and writing.
(P—14, p.4) These weaknesses were addressed by placement of the Student in collaborative classes for
reading and English, and by goals concerning writing and reading comprehension with objectives
concerning decoding. (P-l4, pp. 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17)

The PPT held on 6/7/10 identiﬁed mathematics as an area of concern. (P—14, p. 4) These weaknesses were
addressed by goals and objectives in the area of math concepts. (P—l4, pp. 8-9)

The Grade 6 Connecticut Mastery Test Student Report (“CMT”), taken on 3/3/ 10 showed the Student as
scoring Below Basic level on the Mathematics test, mastering 3 out of 23 content strands; scoring Basic
level on the Reading test, mastering 1 out of 4 content strands; and scoring at the Basic level on the Writing
test, mastering 0 out of 2 content strands.

The 6/7/ 10 IEP called for a triennial evaluation to be conducted by 9/ 19/ l 1.

5 The June 1, 2009 IEP is not a subject of this Due Process Hearing but is referenced to provide the proper context for the IEP’s in
question in this matter.

The PPT held on 6/7/10 noted that the Student’s behavior was age appropriate, and that the Student should
be held to the regular school code of conduct. (P-14, p. 5) All Team members are in agreement with the
planned program. (P—l4, p.2)

The Notice and Consent to Conduct a Reevaluation was signed by the Parents on 6/7/10 and received by the
Board on 6/15/10. (13—1)

The first three months of 7''1 grade staited well before the Student sought assistance from Principal N. for
not being able to learn and her perception that she was being bullied. (Tr. Mother p.34)

In November 2010 the Student was involved in an incident on the school bus involving a physical
altercation with another student which resulted in both students being suspended. This Student was given a
two day suspension; the other student received a one day suspension. (1d. p.36 )

1n the months ofDecembe1‘2010, January 2011 and February 201 1, Parents reported continued physical and
verbal harassment of the Student. Parents reported hair pulling, cailing the Student “fat, stupid” and calling
the Student a boy. In February 2011 additional students were involved, allegedly following the Student
home and calling the Student “gay, dyke, lesbian”. The Parents reported this behavior to the Principal and
the school based Enﬁeld Police. (Tr. Mothe1‘p.39-40)

Principal N. stated that there were no investigative reports or documentation of any investigations. (Tr.
Principal N. p.81)

The most recent formal evaluation of the Student, a neuropsychological evaluation requested by the Parents,
was conducted by independent Neuropsychologist. The evaluation was conducted over the time period of
2/ 12/ 1 1, 8/2/ 11 and 9/7/11, and stated the following diagnoses:

a) Mathematics Disorder

b) Reading Disorder

0) Disorder of Written Expression

d) Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder of the Inattentive Type

e) Learning Disorder Not Otherwise Speciﬁed (Executive Dysfunction)

t) Adjustment Disorder with mixed emotional features

g) Rule out Overanxious Disorder

The neuropsychological evaluation was independently sought by the Parents for the purposes of “clarifying
the student’s learning proﬁle, understand the impact of bullying on her emotional status, and provide
appropriate educational recommendations in order to facilitate her safe return to school”. (P—24)

The Student was evaluated by Independent Neuropsychologist over three sessions, beginning on 2/12/1 1,
followed by 8/2/11 and 9/7/11. (P-24 p.1, Tr. Independent Neui‘opsychologist p.89)

The following records provided by the Parents were reviewed for the evaluation: 2007—2010 Connecticut
Mastery Test Student Reports, Grades 3-6; Planning and Placement Team Meeting, dated 1/18/07
(determination of eligibility for special education); Letters/Notiﬁcations between Parents and Central
Administration at Enﬁeld Public Schools, dated 2007—201 1; School suspension notice, Henry Barnard
Elementary School, Enﬁeld Public Schools (suspension for bullying), dated 11/27/07; Planning and

Independent Neuropsychologist reported background information that was provided by the Student and
Parents. The information is reported as told to her in her report. Independent Neuropsychologist felt that
the information helps to set the framework allowing her to get to know the student and to understand the
dynamics of an individual in a short period of lime. (Tr. Independent Neuropsychologist, p.107). Clinical
assessments are utilized to make her ﬁndings. (Tr. Independent Neuropsychologist, p. 107—108)

Twenty assessments were utilized in conducting both a neuropsychological and a psychological evaluation.
The Tests administered were:

a) Auditmy Attention Test

b) Category Test — Intermediate

0) Children’s Color Trails Test

(1) Clinical Interview

e) Conners Continuous Performance Test—II

t) Controlled Oral Word Fluency Test

g) D 2 Test of Attention

i) Gray Oral Reading Test — 4

j) Grooved Pegboard Test

k) Hooper Visual Organization Test

1) Kaufman Brief Intelligence ~ 2

m) Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory

0) Record Review

p) Sentence Repetition Test

q) Stroop Color and Word Test — Children’s version
r) Symbol Digit Modalities Test

3) Test of Nonverbal Intelligence — 4

t) Visuomotor Integration Test. (P—24, p. 24)

Independent Neuropsychologist found that the Student’s intellectual functioning was consistent with prior
testing by the Board. (Tr. Independent Neuropsychologist, p. 16). Culturally normed instruments were
utilized to account for the Student’s introduction to the Hispanic culture. (Id. p. 112)

Testing data showed difﬁculties in Sustained attention in both auditory and visual areas and difﬁculties with
executive functioning or cognitive ﬂexibility. (Id. p. 17)

The Student showed auditoty processing difﬁculties in that she can hear but she has difﬁculty processing
what she hears and then responding to it. (Tr. Independent Neuropsychologist pp. 1 13—1 14)

Processing speed is very low at the ﬁrst percentile. (Id.; P-24 p9) Testing showed difﬁculty with problem
solving and demonstrated pre-fi‘ontal or executive ﬁmctioning difﬁculties on multiple measures. (Tr.
Independent Neuropsychologist, p. 17) The Student scored low on a test of single word decoding. (1d,)
Results of the Gray Oral Reading Test showed low scores in the area of ﬂuency, accuracy and decoding. (Id.
1113)

October 4, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0363

35. Writing showed difﬁculties with contextual language, formation of sentences, capitalization, punctuation
and spelling. (Id) Handwriting declined as the Student became fatigued. (1d.)

36. In math, the Student showed difﬁculties in both basic calculations and mathematics reasoning. (Id)

37. With regard to attention, the Student had difﬁculties in multiple areas whether auditory or Visual. (Id. p. 20)
The loss of attention over time, in conjunction with the executive functioning difﬁculties was consistent
with a diagnosis of ADHD, lnattentive type. (Id. p. 20)

38, The Connors Continuous Performance Test and the D2 Test of Attention demonstrated a vigilance decrease
over time. (1d. p. 115).

39. The Student scored in the below average range on the story comprehension test, which measured her
comprehension after hearing something auditorily.

40. On the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory, the Student ascribed to significant expressed concerns.
She feels considerable distress when viewing herself and has awareness that others reject her as well. She
also endorsed higher than typical distress concerning her sexuality, reporting feelings of confusion and
unhappiness with her impulses 01' the roles they may require of her. (13-24. p. 13-14) She experienced a
sense of isolation and rejection from peers. (1d.p. l 4)

41. Neuropsychological assessment pointed to average intellectual functioning on two separate measures with
no statistical variance between verbal and nonverbal skills. Despite the Student’s average intelligence, her
academic skills were lower. Reading ranked at the below average range, writing at the poor range and
mathematics at the very poor range. She struggled with reading decoding, ﬂuency and encoding. Writing
skills were marked by poor contextual language: weakness in capitalization/punctuation, poor sentence
structure, and spelling errors. Story construction was much stronger as was reading comprehension.
Mathematics was poor for both mental and written computations. The ﬁndings were clearly consistent with
Speciﬁc Learning Disabilities in reading, writing, and mathematics. (P-24, p. 15)

42. Independent Neuropsychologist made 21 recommendations following her evaluation. One of her
recommendations was that given the Student’s personality dynamics, her learning difﬁculties and cognitive
deﬁcits, the Team should consider outplacement in a small specialized, therapeutic school where staff can
address her direct psychological and cognitive needs. (P—24, p. 16)

43. Another recommendation was to conduct an independent assistive technology evaluation in order to
determine appropriate compensatory tools that may enhance her performance in reading, writing and math
within the classroom.

44. She also recommended social skills suppon to develop positive social relationships, improve her social
comfort, and minimize her fear of ridicule and rejection.

45. She recommended that the Team develop a detailed behavioral management program to minimize reactivity
and the Student’s own negative response or acting—out in response to incidents. To this end, a Functional
Behavioral Assessment was recommended to be performed by an outside, specialized consultant to devise
the progrannning if one is not afforded within her placement; in addition, therapeutic support in order to
provide a safe medium for communication, build self—esteem and discuss appropriate problem solving
strategies when difﬁcult situations arise were also recommended. (P—24, p.17)

Independent Neuropsychologist testiﬁed in regard to the 2008 evaluation that was completed by the district,
that if the Student had made academic progress, 11erscores from the 2008 evaluation would have increased
in the 2011 evaluation. (Tr. Independent Neuropsychologist, pp. 32-33) She further opined that because
there was no change, the Student had made limited progress. (Id. p.33)

Independent Neuropsychologist testiﬁed that the tests utilized in the 2008 and 201 1 evaluations were similar
and that only the reading comprehension test on the 2011 evaluation was more difﬁcult. (10'. p.33) The
Word Reading score from the 2008 evaluation was comparable to the alphabet work knowledge on the 2011
test where the Student’s score dropped by ﬁve points. (Id. p. 33; P-8 p.4; P—24, p.12)

The results of the assessments given by Independent Neuropsychologist indicate that the Student is
functioning below grade level in all academic areas. (P—24, p.12)

Independent Neuropsychologist was speciﬁc in how her recommendations should be implemented. She
believed that the sewices had to be direct sewices aimed at those identiﬁed areas of deﬁcit which related to
academics. Whether delivered in a resource room environment or whatever setting they chose, it had to be
direct and it had to be systematic and theoretically based programming to enhance those disabled areas. (Tr.
Independent Neuropsychologist p.126)

In the evaluation process Independent Neuropsychologist did not speak with any members of the JFKMS
staff, obsewe the JFKMS program, speak with any community treating clinicians, or review any non-
evaluative information that was not provided by the Student or the Student’s mother. (P—24, pp. 1-7; Tr.
Independent Neuropsychologist, p. 79)

School Psychologist, the Enﬁeld School Psychologist, was questioned as to the neuropsychological
evaluation conducted by Independent Neuropsychologist. (Tr. School Psychologist p.24) He opined that the
norm referenced testing seemed “pretty good” with regard to the Student’s cognitive proﬁle and academic
strengths and weaknesses. (Id. p.24)

He acknowledged that Independent Neuropsychologist reviewed the school records that existed prior to the
stait of her testing and that therefore she had received a repon of what was occun‘ing in school. (Id. p.40)

Without ﬁlrther clariﬁcation, he opined that some of the ﬁndings were inconsistent with school records. (Id.
13-39)

School Psychologist was concerned about the ﬁndings regarding social—emotional issues. (Tr. School
Psychologist p.24) School Psychologist preferred the Behavior Assessment System Checklist for Children

(“BASC”). (1d. pp.24-25)

His opinion was that utilizing a multi-modal approach, such as is recommended by the National Association
of School Psychologists, provided a broader, more accurate depiction of the Student when evaluating for
emotional issues. (Tr. School Psychologist pp.75-82) He felt that the information regarding the
social/emotional issues was gathered from non~n0rmed reference materials. (Id. pp.24-26)

The Millon Adolescent Personality lnventoxy is a normed testing evaluation which requires the taker to

respond to 375 questions about themselves, and contains validity measures built in to determine if the
repoﬁer is being less than candid. (Tr. Independent Neuropsychologist p.130) Independent

Neuropsychologist felt that there were no indications of misrepresentations by the Student in any of the tests
that were taken. (1d,)

The Student reported to her Parents that she was threatened by other students that if she attended the annual
Valentine’s Day dance, she would be verbally accosted again until she admitted to being bi—sexual. (Tr.
Mother p. 45)

The Student requested her money back for the Valentine’s Day dance from Principal N. and did not attend.
The Student’s money was refunded and there was no further contact from the school regarding the situation.
(Tr. Mother pp. 45-46)

The words “Bitch” and “Lesbian” were carved into the Student’s homeroom locker door. The principal
spoke to the Student’s homeroom teacher about the incident but did not ask what speciﬁcally was written
there, assigned the Student a new locker and instructed the janitorial staff to remove the offensive language
from the locker. The Principal never investigated the locker door and does not know if the language was
ever removed. (Tr. Principal N. p.32)

The School took two weeks to provide the student with a new locker but never removed the derogatory
language from the original locker door. (Tr. Mother pp. 48—49)

No investigative report was created by the Board or provided to the Parents. No forms to report bullying or
sexual harassment were provided to either the Student or her Parents. (Record)

It is the general policy of the principal and the staff to inform “people” when they talked to them that they
could ﬁll out the Board’s forms for bullying. (Tr. Principal N. p.20)

The Student reported to her Parents that the bullying continued throughout the school and on the bus, with
other students threatening to “jump” her and calling her names such as “dyke”, “gay” and “lesbian”. Other
students told the Parents that they witnessed these acts.

Mother called the principal and the in-sehool police ofﬁcer. Principal N. told mother that these behaviors
were “kid stuff". (Tr. Mother pp.42-43, 94-95)

The bullying and sexual harassment behavior continued into the lunchroom; the Student stopped going to
lunch with her peers. (Tr. Mother p. 44).

Principal N. was aware that the Parents were concerned about the possibility of their daughter being bullied
and had reported it on various occasions directly to him. (Tr. Principal N. p.72)

Principal N. was aware that the Parents were asking for the instruction given to their daughter to be done in
a more concrete way. Principal N. felt that the request was “kind of below [the Student’s] level and that the
teachers were asking higher level questions. (Id. pp.95-96)

The 2008 evaluation conducted by and in the possession of the school found that the Student had more
success learning things in context versus isolation and that she had difﬁculty retaining and sequencing
information. (P-8 p.8) The neuropsychological evaluation conducted by Independent Neuropsychologist
recommended utilizing repetition and breaking tasks down for the Student. (P-24 p.16)

Independent Neuropsychologist opined that she had no doubt that the Student had been bullied. (Tr.
Independent Neuropsychologist, p.44) It was her opinion that the bullying would have a signiﬁcant impact
on the Student, given her fragile emotional state and her struggles with her sexuality; in conjunction with the
reality of her father’s cancer, it would be debilitating for her. (1d. p.45) Independent Neuropsychologist
fuither opined that because the testing showed that the Student does not like to lose control, the fact that she
did would suggest that the triggers were beyond what she was capable of dealing with. (Id. p.60)
Independent Neuropsychologist recommended therapy and medication management, both in and out of
school. (Id. p.50)

Independent Neuropsychologist opined that if the Student were placed back with the students who bullied
her, the possibility of hurting herself or someone else would be elevated. (Id. p.62)

From the month of February 2011 onward, the Student spent her lunch period outside of the Principal’s
ofﬁce. Most times she was not eating lunch. (Tr. Principal N. p. 23) Principal N. called the Student’s
parent once to report that she was eating lunch outside of his ofﬁce. (1d. p.23) Principal N. felt it was an
issue between the Student and her Parents. (1d. p. 140)

The Student took the Connecticut Mastery Test in March 2011. She scored at the Below Basic level on the
Mathematics test, mastering 0 out of 23 content strands. She scored at the Basic level on the Grade 7
Reading test, mastering 3 out of 4 content strands, and she scored Below Basic level on the Grade 7 Writing
test, mastering 0 out of 2 content strands. The Vertical scores indicated that there was negligible
improvement from 2010 in Mathematics, with the Student entering Stage 2 (the School and District
averages were at the last third ofStage 4); she showed more marked improvement in Reading, barely
entering Stage 3 (the School and District were in the last third of Stage 4). (P—15)

May 9, 2011, the Student was called to the ofﬁce for allegedly striking her Art teacher; Student was sent
home. The next day the Parents are told to bring the Student to the school by the Enﬁeld Police, where she
was arrested for assault. (B-S pp.9—10)

The Student refused to return to school from that point onward. (Tr. Principal N. p.162)

No evidence was presented that any school official requested a PPT to address the Student’s changing
grades, the increased acting out behaviors, her extended absence from school 01' to question the efﬁcacy of
the current IEP. (Record)

From May 0f201 1 until March 23, 201 l the Student received no tutoring or educational services. (Tr.
Mother p. 79)

Principal Ni testiﬁed that he could not remember if he ever read a letter dated 5/ 10/ l I sent from the
Student’s father that mentioned bullying by several students of his daughter. (Tr. Principal N. pp. 72-74)
Principal N. was consistently inconsistent in his testimony regarding his knowledge of and response to any
complaints of bullying of the Student. (Tr. Principal N.)

A PPT was held on 6/ 10/1 1. (P-l4) Team members present were: Principal T. Principal N., Mother, Special
Education Teacher, School Psychologist, Guidance Counselor, Regular Education Teacher, Special
Education Coordinator, Counsel for the Board and Counsel for the Parents.

79. At the 6/ 10/ ll PPT, Mother informed the school that the Student was being bullied and sexually harassed.
(Tr. Mother p.60; B-2 p.3) The Student had been absent 48 days at that point. The Parents requested a
safety plan to help the Student return to the school in response to the allegations of bullying and sexual
harassment. (B-2 p43) No safety plan was incorporated into the IEP developed on 6/10/1 1. No transition
plan was developed to return the Student to school. No investigation was suggested by the School
Administration and no forms requesting information regarding the bullying or sexual harassment were given
to the Parents. (B-2)

80. The School Psychologist reviewed and utilized the 2008 psycho—educational testing for the purposes of
providing information for the 6/10/11 PPT, stating that formal triennial evaluations could not be completed
due to the Student’s absences. (B-2 p.2)

8]. Parental consent for the triennial evaluation had been signed on 6/7/10. (P—21)

82. School Psychologist stated that it would have taken him only three or four class periods to complete his
testing but that he had not made any attempts to do so because it was his practice to test as close to the
triennial date as possible. (Tr. School Psychologist p.22) He further testiﬁed that it was best practice to‘test
within 30 days of the triennial, that sometimes there were exceptions to testing earlier than that and doing so
would not invalidate the testing. (Id. pp. 55-57)

83. School Psychologist testiﬁed that he could have tested the Student even when she was not in school if he
had contacted the Parents to do so, but he did not do so. (Id. p.61) He acknowledged that the Student was in
school for four weeks prior to when her triennial testing was to have been completed? (Id. p.22)

84. School Psychologist acknowledged that at least as of the 6/10/11 PPT meeting, it was clear that the Parents
were reporting bullying and sexual harassment of the Student to the school. (Id. p.42; B-2 p3)

85. School Psychologist did not recommend, either at the PPT or during the time the Student was absent,
counseling sewices, either community based or with himself. (Id. p.35; p.76) He did not provide or
recommend the provision of bullying or sexual harassment forms to the Student or her Parents after hearing
the allegations at the 6/ 10/ 11 PPT. (Id. pp.43~44)

86. The 6/ 10/ l 1 PPT was the ﬁrst PPT that the Special Education Coordinator attended for the Student.
(Id.p.l3; B-2)

87. Special Education Coordinator testiﬁed that she would have reviewed the Student’s CMT scores prior to
attending the PPT and that she was aware that the Student had not at any time reached proﬁciency in
reading, writing 01' math. (Tr. Stamm p160-62) She further testiﬁed that the CMT scores from the previous
year would have been one of the documents that they would use in determining programming. (Id. pp160—
62)

88. Special Education Coordinator felt that the Student was performing adequately academically and that she
herself did not raise concerns regarding the Student’s academics. (Ids p.17) In response to reviewing the
teacher reports that documented attentional, social, emotional, behavioral and academic concerns, she felt

‘5 There is a discrepancy in when the triennial evaluation was due as the 6/7/10 IEP lists both 6/19/1 l and 9/19/1 l as the date by which

it was to be completed. (P-l4 p.2-3)

that the only concerns were homework and work completion. (Id. pp.19-20) She did acknowledge the
increase in absences throughout the year. (1d. p.22)

Special Education Coordinator acknowledged receiving a letter from the Student’s treating Clinician
diagnosing the Student with a Major Depressive Disorder. (Id. p.28) She could not recall anyone at the
PPT questioning the diagnosis, including herself. (161.) She did testify under cross~examination that even
though no one questioned the diagnosis at the 6/10/11 and subsequent PPT meetings, the school did not
believe the diagnosis was valid due to having no documentation other than the letter from her treating
clinician and an independent neuropsychologist. (Id. pp.82—83)

Special Education Coordinator was aware that the Student had reading issues when creating the IEP at the
June, 201 1 PPT, but did not know the speciﬁcs of why she was having difﬁculty reading. (1d. p.43) She
was unable to say if the Student was provided with a specialized reading program, but clariﬁed that if she
was, data from the program would be palt 0f the record. (Id. pp.45—46)

No evidence was presented during the Hearing that data from a reading program was provided to the
Student.

discussed the bullying and sexual harassment allegations with Principal N. (Id. p.88)

Special Education Coordinator was aware, at least as of the June, 2011 PPT, of teacher repoﬁs that the
Student was having difﬁculty with peers, including having to be separated from her peers in class,
threatening and eventually being arrested for assaulting a teacher. (Id. pp.90-91) Special Education
Coordinator felt that despite the reports, the discipline record, and the extended student absences, the
Student did not have a social or emotional issue. (1d. p.92)

Special Education Coordinator did not recommend at the June, 201 1 PPT a functional behavioral
assessment, a safety plan, or a transition plan to bring the Student back to the school. (ld.p.58)

Special Education Teacher was the Student’s Special Education Teacher during the seventh and eighth
grades. (Tr. Special Education Teacher p.35) The Student was one of 16 special education students that
Special Education Teacher had during the Student’s seventh grade. (Id. pp.35, 37) In the Student’s suppon
class, she was one of ten that Special Education Teacher would provide direct instruction to. (Id. p.36)

The J une, 2011 PPT would have developed the Student’s IEP that Special Education Teacher would have
implemented in the seventh grade for the 2010-2011 school year. (Id. pp,37-38)

Special Education Teacher testiﬁed that the expectation for students as they progress from grade to grade

goals and objectives for the Student’s sixth, seventh and eighth grades were identical, save for the change in
grade level. (1d. pp.39-40)

100. Special Education Teacher testiﬁed that the objective listed in the Student’s IEPs from sixth through eighth
grade, such as phonics, is a skill that is mastered in the third or fourth grade. Once it is mastered, there is no
need to have it re—learned. Once one learns phonics, you are essentially able to read. (Id. p.61)

101. Special Education Teacher testiﬁed that even if the Student had made 70% progress on her goals and
objectives, which was the marker for mastery of the goal and objectives (Id. p.81), they would not be
considered mastered and could be repeated without increasing any expectations year after year. (1d. pp.62-
63)

102. The Special Education Teacher was not aware of the Student’s cognitive level, and believed that the Student
had learning disabilities in math, reading and writing and not in any other areas. (1d. p.63)

103. Special Education Teacher does not believe that the Student was bullied. (Id. p.48)

104. The Parents requested receipt of academic assignments and a tutor for the Student in her absence. The Team
decided that Guidance would notify Mother when assignments were available and that Counsel would be
notiﬁed when a decision was reached regarding tutoring. (B—2 p.3)

105. In early October, 201 1 the District became aware of the Student receiving a diagnosis of Major Depressive
Disorder, single episode, moderate and Peer Relationship Problems by way of a letter provided to the
District from the Student’s treating clinician from The Village7. (P-27; Tr. Mother p.77) The clinician
recommended that the Student receive homebound tutoring while the school worked to build “an
environment that is supportive to her and that she views as caring, accommodating and safe”. (P-27)

106. The District, through Special Education Coordinator, attempted to locate a tutori Near the end of October
2011, through counsel, the Parents were informed that a tutor had been located and would be contacting the
family. (P-28) Problems ensued with matching a tutor with the times and locations that the tutor and the
Student were able to meet. (Tr. Mother pp.77—78; P~31) Issues outside of the control of the District, and to
a large extent, the family (medical issues, other sibling issues, size of the apartment that the family lived in)
interfered with the establishment of the tutoring services.

107. The Board provided Homebound instruction after receiving the letter from the Student’s clinician in October
201 1, despite the family not meeting the requirements of state law for Homebound instruction.

with an individual behavior plan to address speciﬁc targets of: school attendance, mutual respectful
relationships between peers and adults, and access to support services‘ (B—3 p.2) One half hour per week of
social work services were added and an assistive technology evaluation would be conducted. IEP goals,
objectives and modiﬁcations established at the 6/ 10/11 IEP would remain in effect. The actions proposed
were to be implemented a “minimum of ﬁve school days from date parent received prior written notice,
dated: 12/06/2011”. (B-3 p.4)

been resolved. (Record)

] 15. The District did not support the recormnendation for outplacement made by Independent Neuropsychologist
because the District believed that the teacher reports and the Student’s present level of performance did not
warrant an outplacement; the Board felt they had an appropriate program to offer the Student. (Tr. Stamm
pp.67—68) The Parent’s report that the Student was terriﬁed to return to school was considered in the
decision to return the Student to the same program the Student had been receiving. (Id. p.68)

1 16. The eighth grade Principal testiﬁed that he was aware at the PPT that the Parents had raised concerns about
the Student returning to the school and that they discussed interactions with teachers and students. (Tr.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:

1. The Student is a thirteen years old; she was deemed eligible for special education and related services by the
Board as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (“IDEA”) as a student with a
Speciﬁc Learning Disability and is entitled to a free appropriate public education (“FAPE”) with special
education and related services to be provided at public expense pursuant to 20 U.S.C. §§1401, et seq. , 34 CPR.
§300 et seq. and Connecticut General Statutes §§ 10~76 et seq. and Connecticut State Regulations §761(d).

2. The Board has the burden of proving the appropriateness of the program and placement that they have
offered, and this burden must be met by a preponderance of the evidence. R.S.A. §10-76h~14(a) see also,
Walczak v. Florida Free Union Sch. Dist, 142 F.2d 119, 122 (2d Cir. 1998)

3. A patty seeking a private placement or program must prove the appropriateness of such placement or
program by a preponderance of the evidence. R.S.A. §10-76h-14(c)

4. The purpose of IDEA is to ensure that all Children with disabilities have available to them a FAPE that
emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for
futther education, employment and independent living and to “ensure that the rights of children with
disabilities and Parents of such children are protected. . .” 20 U.S.C. §1400(d)(1)

5. “Special Education” means: “specially designed instruction at no cost to Parents to meet the unique needs of
a child with a disability.” 20 U.S.C. §1401(25)

6. “Related Services” means : t1'ansp011ation,and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive sewices
(including speech/language pathology and audiology services, psychological services, physical and
occupational therapy, recreation, including therapeutic recreation, social work sewices, counseling services,
including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical sewices, except that such
medical services shall be for diagnostic and evaluation purposes on1y) as may be required to assist a child
with a disability to benefit from special education, including the early identiﬁcation and assessment of
disabling conditions in children. 20 U.S.C. §1401(22)

The standard for determining whether a Board has provided FAPE is set forth in a two part inquiry. Bd Qf
Educ, 0f the Hendrick Hudson Central Sch, Dist. v. Rowley, 458 US. 176 (1982).

The two pronged standard for determining whether the Board offered the Student an appropriate IEP for the
2010-1 1 and 201 1—12 school years is: ﬁrst, whether the procedural requirements of IDEA have been met and
second whether the IEP is "reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits."
Rowley, 458 US. 176, 206-07 (1982). “Only if a court determines that a challenged IEP was inadequate
should it proceed to the question of the appropriateness of the Parents’ proposed outplacement.” M. C. ex rel,
Mrs. C, v. Voluntawn Bd. ofEd, 226 F.3d 60, 66 (2d Cir. 2000)

Relief for procedural Violations is only warranted when FAPE has been denied. ./.S'. v. Pawlett Sch. Dist.,
224 F.3d 60,69 (2d Cir. 2000)

“In matters alleging a procedural violation, a hearing ofﬁcer may find that a child did not receive a FAPE
only if the procedural inadequacies-- (i) lmpeded the child's right to a FAPE; (ii) Signiﬁcantly impeded the
parent's oppoxtunity t0 palticipate in the decision-Inaking process regarding the provision of a FAPE to the
parent‘s child; or (iii) Caused a deprivation ofeducational benefit.” 34 CFR §300.513 (a)(2)

According to IDEA, a denial of a FAPE can be found if the procedural inadequacies of a district
“[s]igniﬁcantly impeded the parent’s opportunity to participate in the decision-making process regarding the
provision of a FAPE to the parent’s child”, even without a showing of educational harm. 34 C .F.R.
§300.513(a)(2) See also WA. v. Pascar‘ella, 153 F. Supp 2d 144 (D. Conn 2001)

The Student alleges procedural violations on the part of the Board to the extent that that there was a denial of
a FAPE. Of the three conditions described in 34 C.F.R. §300.513, condition (ii) will be addressed ﬁrst.
During the academic years in question in this matter, 2010-2011, 201 1-2012 and 2012—2013, no evidence
was presented that showed that the Board failed to send timely notices of the PPTs or that they failed to
invite or have present the necessary parties at the PPT meetings. The Parents were represented by Mother,
Father and/or legal counsel at each of the PPT meetings. Historically, the Student has paiticipated in PPT
meetings (6/7/2010), though unfortunately that has not been the case during the last few meetings. Nothing
has been presented which indicates that the Board either prevented or discouraged the Student from
participating. Nothing in the record suggests that the Parents or their legal counsel were not afforded an
opportunity to participate in the PPT or to voice their concerns or suggestions for the Team to consider. In
all respects it appears that the Parents were afforded an opportunity to participate in the meetings.

There remain two other situations in which a Hearing Ofﬁcer may ﬁnd that a procedural inadequacy was
sufﬁcient to deny a FAPE; (i) if the inadequacy impeded a child’s right to a FAPE, or (iii) the procedural
inadequacy caused a deprivation of educational beneﬁt. 34 C.F.R. §300.513 (a)(2) The IDEA does not
require the district to provide a student with everything that might be thought desirable by loving Parents.
Tucker v, Bay Shore Union Free School District, 873 F.2d 563, 567 (1989) The IDEA requires only that a
school board provide each child a “basic ﬂoor of opportunity” A.E. v. Westport Board of Ed, 46 IDELR
277 (D. Conn. 2006) The Board argues that all procedural requirements were met for all years in question in
this matter. They point to the IEPs created in this matter as demonstrative of that fact. The Parents argue
that the Board failed procedurally by failing to reevaluate the Student when it became apparent through the
Student’s behaviors, academic performance and deteriorating interpersonal relationships that she was
struggling under the IEP as written.

The law requires that a student must be reevaluated if the educational or related service needs, including
academic achievement and functional performance of the child warrant a reevaluation. 34 C.F.R.
§300.303(a)(1)

In the June, 2010 IEP, the Team called for and wrote into the IEP that a functional behavioral assessment
was to be completed by June, 2011. To date, no functional behavioral assessment has been completed.

Under no circumstances can a student go longer than three years without a reevaluation unless the Parent and
the school agree the reevaluation is not needed. 34 C.F.R. §300.303(b)(2)

Screening used for instructional purposes is not evaluation. 34 C.F.R. §300.302

The IEP must set forth goals and objectives which provide a mechanism to determine whether the placement
and services are enabling the child to make educational progress. 20 U.S.C. §1401(a)(20)

An IEP must include a statement of the child’s present level of performance, a statement of measurable
annual goals, including academic and functional goals designed to meet each of the child’s educational needs
that result from the child’s disability. 34 C.F.R. §300.320(a)(1)(2). All of the IEPS in question in this matter
fail to provide functional goals that are designed to meet each of the Student’s educational needs that arise
from her disabilities. Each goal and objective is global in nature, does not provide for individualized
instruction, indeed they seem generic and applicable to any student, and describe no supportive services that
will help her achieve those goals and objectives. The fact that these goals and objectives are repeated
annually supports that the goals and objectives are not speciﬁc enough to either allow the Student to make
incremental advances or indicate at what point the Student needs additional assistance; they do not allow for
measurable increases which would then support the validity of the goal and objectives themselves.

The IEP must contain a statement of the individualized instruction and related services and supports to
enable the child to advance toward attaining the goals. 34 C.F.R. §300.320(a)(4)

The June 2009 IEP, which determined the working IEP for the Student’s 7Ih grade, did not provide
individualized instruction and related services and supports to enable the Student to advance towards
attaining those goals. The June 2009 IEP replicates the two preceding lEPs, with the same goals and
objectives. None of the three IEPs addresses the 2008 evaluation’s recommendations for assisting the
Student in achieving progress. The 2008 evaluation provided strategies for reading, handwriting,
mathematics and memory enhancements, none of which are shown in the form of individualized instruction
or related services. The 2009 IEP, like its predecessors, provides global goals and objectives where the
evaluation is clear that step by step instructions are required for this Student to gain beneﬁt. Subsequent
IEPs are likewise deﬁcient. Each successor goal and objective seems to bear little correlation to the actual
levels of performance of the Student herself. Even where the same goals and objectives are repeated
throughout the IEPS in question, such as in mathematics, they do not address where the Student is struggling
and what will be done to overcome that struggle; goals and objectives are simply repeated again and again.

The IEP must be reviewed not less than annually to determine whether the goals are being achieved and the
IEP must be revised to address any lack of expected progress toward annual goals, to address the results of
any reevaluations, to consider information about the child provided to, 01' by, the Parents, and to address the
student’s anticipated needs. 34 C.F.R. §300.324(b)(ii)(A-E)

The Board satisﬁed the requirement to review each IEP annually. However, there is nothing in the IEP
summaries that indicates discussion around achievement or lack thereof for any goal. The testimony by the
Special Education teacher vacillated between whether the Student achieved the required 70% goal ()1 she did
not. When the teacher testiﬁed that the goal was reached, she then stated that keeping the same goal and
objective despite reaching the performance indicator was sufﬁcient. If that is the case the Board failed to
adjust the IEP to reﬂect the Student’s progress; if the teacher was incorrect and the Student did not reach the
performance goal, then the Board was deﬁcient for not adjusting the goals and objectives to account for the
lack of progress. Either way, the IEPs were deﬁcient.

Failure by the Board to develop an IEP in accordance with procedures mandated by IDEA, in and of itself,
can be deemed a denial 01a FAPE. Amanda .1 ex rel Annette J v. Clark County Sch. Dist. 267 F.3d 877,
9th Cir (2001)

The Board has failed to develop the IEP in accordance with procedures mandated by iDEA resulting in a
denial of the Student’s right to a FAPE and a deprivation of educational beneﬁts.

Connecticut coutts have determined that in order for an IEP to be found appropriate, it must provide more
than mere trivial advancement, it must be one that is “likely to produce progress, not regress.” Mrs. B. v.
MilfardB.0.E., 103 F.2d 1114, 1121 (2d Cir. 1997)

The student’s capabilities, intellectual progress and what the LEA has to offer must be considered along with
grade promotions and test scores in determining whether the program offered is reasonably calculated to
confer a nontrivial 01‘ meaningful educational beneﬁt to the child. See Hall v. Vance County Bd. ofEd. 774
RM 629, 635 (1985)

Objective factors such as passing marks and advancement from grade to grade can be indicators of
meaningful educational beneﬁts but are not in and of themselves dispositive. See Mrs, B. v. Milford B. 0.E.,
103 F.2d 1120 (2d Cir. 1997)

The Board’s 2008 evaluation indicated that the student was struggling in all areas. She had not mastered
sound/symbol relationships, basic math facts, 01 basic w1'1ting skills such as punctuation and capitalization ‘
and spelling. She compensated for these deﬁcits through her well- developed verbal skills At the point that
the Board’ 3 2008 evaluation was written, the relevant CMT sco1es (3ml Grade) that we1e utilized by the
evaluat01 indicated that the Student sco1ed Below Basic level on Mathematics, Reading and W1iting tests.
Her full scale IQ determined through the evaluation was Low Average. A review of the CMT Student Scores
taken since the 2008 evaluation show that the Student has never achieved a score higher than Below Basic in
Mathematics, the Student was able to 1each a score of Basic on the Reading test and has maintained that
level, but IS still signiﬁcantly below the school average and the distlict avelage. The Student regiessed fiom
the Basic level in W1iting 111 the 5‘h and 6Ih glades t0 Below Basic 011 the 7'“ grade W1iting test. It Is
imponant to note that when the school psychologist who evaluated the Student In 2008 asked the teachers of
the Student to describe her, the Student had been described as demonstrating a positive attitude toward
learning, good work habits and study skills and an ability to interact with others.

The relevant evidence presented in this matter suggests that there has been little academic progress for this
Student since that 2008 evaluation. The IEPs still indicate that the Student stmggles with basic mathematics,
understanding and solving word problems, multi-step problems, math vocabulary, computing negative
integers, fractions with unlike denominations, decimals, using functions of a scientiﬁc calculator. She

stmggles with writing, spelling, organization, comprehension, elaboration in writing, applying strategies in
compositions, applying editing/revising skills to written work.

The preceding June, 2011 IEP does not contain social work services. At that point the Student had not been
in school since the previous May and all of the behavioral issues concerning peers and teachers would have
already occurred. The functional behavioral assessment, which would have addressed those behaviors, was
to have been completed for the June, 201 1 PPT.

The November 29, 201 1 IEP references no changes in goals or objectives despite the fact that the teachers
provided “recollections” of her behavior because they have not seen the Student since the prior May, there
are no current grades 01' evaluations to consider, and no one from the school has had contact with this Student
in eight months.

It is noted on the November 2011 IEP that the Student has a three year history of extensive school absences
however no evidence of this was presented nor is there any discussion or resolution as to how this issue will
be addressed and resolved.

Independent Neuropsychologist’s evaluation was presented and discussed. A need to conduct a functional
behavioral assessment was made a part of the IEP, as well as the need to conduct an assistive technology
evaluation, and a half hour per week of counseling with the school social worker was provided.

These are the only recommendations taken from the neuropsychological evaluation.

The results garnered by the neuropsychological and psychological evaluation conducted by Independent
Neuropsychologist mirror the results of the Board’s 2008 evaluation.

The testimony of Independent Neuropsychologist was credible and noteworthy, despite the Board’s
objections to the issues raised by Independent Neuropsychologist of poor socialization skills. The Board
feels that because Independent Neuropsychologist did not speak to the teachers, did not observe the student
in the program, her perspective of the Student is tainted by presumably faulty information provided by the
Parents and Student.

The Board did not provide any concrete evidence that any of the information provided by the Parent or the
Student was actually untrue.

The Board’s witness, School Psychologist, found no fault with the normed evaluations that were given and
found the results to be properly attained.

Independent Neuropsychologist testiﬁed that not only was normed testing material utilized, the evaluation
was also culturally normed to the Student’s exposure to Hispanic culture.

Independent Neuropsychologist found that the Student achieved Virtually the same scores on both
evaluations. This was of concern to her as it indicated that despite the passage of almost three years and the
implementation of the program provided by the Board, the Student had not made the progress that she would
have expected.

Independent Neuropsychologist compared the testing that she utilized with the testing completed by the
Board in 2008. In her professional opinion, and with corresponding data, the evaluations were very similar

and comparable. She pointed out the differences and what effect those differences might present when
comparing the two evaluations.

The Board did not present any evidence 01‘ testimony that disputed her comparison of the two evaluations, or
the results that were garnered by each.

The Board’s exhibits indicated that the Student had made progress through their program, had achieved
moderate success with her grades in her subjects, and that she had been promoted from the seventh grade to
the eighth grade and was now being promoted to the ninth grade.

The only empirical evidence in the record showing the progress of the Student is the CMT scores, the interim
report cards and the one repoﬁ card in evidence that showed grades for the 3rd quaiter of 201 1. That report
card showed 14 days absence that quarter alone and 36 days absence for the year to date. The grades were
low C’s, regressing from earlier grades of B’s and Cs. The Interim Grade Reports in evidence showed from
October, 2010 through March, 201 1 there was a steady decline in the Student’s grades, from A’s and B’s to
F’s and low C’s. (P-19)

The Interim Report Cards contain pleas by the Parents to have a meeting to discuss the Student’s grades,
make-up work and the instructional process with their daughter.

The evidence also shows that almost every teacher indicated that the Student was lagging considerably in
completing homework, to the degree that grades in classes were being inferred from minimal work
completed. Disciplinary measures were taken to address the homework issue, apparently to no avail.
Disruptions in class are pointed out, conﬂicts with teachers, some to the point of physical confrontations.
Suspensions occurred.

The Student was arrested for assaulting/threatening a teacher. The Student has not attended class since May
of 201 1.

The functional behavioral assessment has not been completed. A functional behavioral assessment is
essential to addressing a child’s behavioral difﬁculties and as such plays and integral role in the development
of an IEP. Harris v. District ofColumbia, 561 F. Supp. 2d 63 (6/23/08)

Failure to conduct a functional behavioral assessment does not amount to a procedural violation of the IDEA
where the TEP sets forth other means to address the student’s problematic behaviors.

The November 201 1—2012 IEP incorporates one-haif hour of social work services for addressing the
Student’s anxiety surrounding school, low self-esteem, and conﬂicts with peers.

To the extent that the IEP does contain a means to address at least some of the Student’s behavioral issues,
the failure to have the functional behavioral assessment completed for the Nov. 201 l IEP, the failure does
not rise to the level of a procedural violation that deprives the Student of her right to a FAPE, it does
however continue to deprive her of educational beneﬁts and as such it is a denial of the Student’s right to a
FAPE.

Given that the Student had not been in school for almost six months, the IEP should have speciﬁed that the
social worker was to seek out the Student outside of the school setting if necessary, to address the issues, or
that the Board was going to exercise its own power and right to administer the IEP.

Knowing that the Student was not in school and that the IEP was doing nothing to bring her back to school
makes the offer of in-house social work a bit pointless.

It is inconceivable that a Team would attempt to create a program and placement for a child without knowing
the nature and severity of the Student’s disability. The last evaluation of the Student by the Board was in
June, 2008. The triennial evaluation was legally due to occur no later than June, 2011. 34 C.F.R.
§300.303(b)(2)

Under no circumstances can a student g0 longer than three years without a reevaluation unless the Parent and
school agree the evaluation is not necessary. 34 C.F.R. §300.303(b)(2)

The Board argues that the district cannot be faulted for not evaluating the Student because the Parents
refused to allow the district to conduct evaluations. That argument fails to persuade.

The evidence produced at the hearing suggests a different reality. The Parents signed the consent to evaluate
on June 7, 2010; it was stamped as received by the Board on 6/ 15/ 10. That consent was offered into
evidence with no objection from the Parent. (B—l)

Even if the Board was correct that the Parents had refused consent, IDEA provides that if the parent refuses
to consent, the LEA may pursue reevaluation by utilizing the mediation and due process procedures, except
to the extent it is inconsistent with State law relating to parental consent. 20 U.S.C. §1414(a)(1)(c)(ii).
Connecticut State law does not bar the LEA’s pursuit of evaluations, State law and Federal law require only
that the LEA must comply with the procedural safeguards outlined in 34 CPR. §300.504 and the parental
consent requirements of 34 C.F.R. §300.305.

The 6/7/ 10 IEP stated the triennial was to be completed by 6/19/11. The Board failed to produce any
evidence that the Parents rescinded that consent or that the Board attempted to schedule the triennial and the

Parents refused to cooperate.

The last formal evaluation of the Student, by the Board, was completed in 2008. This evaluation has been
utilized by the Board as one of the underpinnings for the Board’s creation of every subsequent IEP since it
was completed.

The ﬁndings of that 2008 evaluation, which were subsequently replicated in greater detail through the
neuropsychological evaluation completed in 2011, provided the Board with a blueprint from which to
develop a program and sewices that would have satisﬁed the Board’s subsequent requirement to provide the
Student with a FAPE.

The failure to reevaluate the Student without agreement between the Parent and the Board that the evaluation
is not necessary is a procedural evaluation for which the consequence is a denial of the Student’s right to a
FAPE, a denial of the Parent’s right to patticipate in the subsequent discussion and analysis of the evaluation
completed, and a deprivation of educational beneﬁts to the Student

The 6/26/ 12 IEP attempts to resolve the issue by incorporating that the school social worker will work with
the student on her transition to the high school, social skills and emotional issues.

Transitions have not been presented by any party as a problem behavior; and counseling can meet the
requirement to provide positive behavioral interventions and support.

To that extent, the Board has negated the procedural Violation of not completing the functional behavioral
assessment for the 2012~2013 academic years, however because it does not address the issue of getting the
Student back into school, the IEP does continue to deprive the Student of educational beneﬁts and thus is a
denial of the Student’s right to a FAPE.

To offer a vital sewice that has no hope of being provided because there is no recipient to receive it and
failing to make a concerted effo1t to connect with the intended recipient is a meaningless gesture. After
almost 18 mos. 0f absences it is all the more incumbent upon the Board to have recognized that at some level
the issues concerning bullying and sexual harassment would have to be dealt with to get this Student back
into the building.

At the 6/26/12 PPT meeting the IEP for the 2012—2013 academic year was created. The Board used the
modiﬁed grades of a tutor who provided eight hours a week of tutoring and determines that the Student has
produced sufﬁcient work with sufﬁcient grades to be promoted to ninth grade and a move to the high school.

No evidence that the tutor provided the required IEP services or material in accordance with the IEP was
presented.

There was no evidence of the actual work performed or the marking system utilized to evaluate that work,
other than saying it was modiﬁed, was presented.

No evidence was presented which showed the credentials of the tutor.

Not a single regular education teacher, not a special education teacher, not an administrator made contact
with this Student from May, 2011 onward.

In terms of her social and emotional realms, this Student has regressed signiﬁcantly. From being described
as positive and demonstrating good work habits on the 2008 evaluation and 2009 IEP, the Team is now
presented with a clinically depressed student who refuses to complete her work, has demonstrated assaultive
and aggressive behaviors to peers and teachers, is currently considered at risk for self-harm and requires
medication to manage her daily life and is totally school avoidant.

If Independent Neuropsychologist’s evaluation had stood in isolation because there was no other evaluation
to compare it to, if the Board had presented empirical data that challenged the results presented from her
evaluation sufﬁciently to call the data into question, more weight would be given to the Board’s perspective
that the social/emotional information garnered was tainted. The Board did not provide evidence that refuted

her ﬁndings

The Board was clear that it disagreed with the characterizations of some of the events provided, but the
Board did not proffer any credible evidence that refuted the information itself.

During the November, 2011 PPT, there is no transition plan created to bring this Student back to school.
This despite the fact that this Student has not been in school for approx. 5 mos. of academic time (May, 2011
— Nov. 2011), despite having numerous notiﬁcations to the Board by the Parents and the Student that they
were raising serious allegations of bullying and sexual harassment. In the Due Process hearing multiple
members of the administration of the school acknowledged they had received notice of the allegations.

There is no safety plan created to allay the Parents fears that their daughter was unsafe in the school setting.

Bullying may amount to a denial of a FAPE when school personnel are deliberately indifferent to, or failed to
take reasonable steps to prevent bullying that substantially restricted a child with learning disabilities in
[their] educational oppottunities. T.K. v. New York City Dept. of Educ, S6 IDELR 228 (4/25/2011). In that
case the District Court stated that when responding to bullying of a student with a disability, a district must
take prompt and appropriate action, including investigating, and taking appropriate steps to prevent it from
recurring. (Id). In TK, as in this case, the principal acknowledged knowing about an incident of bullying,
however the Board denied the allegations that bullying occurred, failed to provide documentation that it
either investigated claims of bullying or took steps to remedy the conduct. (Id)

In this present matter, just as in T.K., the school had no veriﬁed acts of bullying against the student and in
fact the Parents were told that the Student was the aggressor.

To be denied educational beneﬁt a student need not regress but only have her educational beneﬁt adversely
affected. T.K. v. New York City Dept, 0fEduc., 56 IDELR 228 (4/25/2011)

Independent Neuropsychologist’s opinion was that the Student had been bullied, the result of which had a
signiﬁcant negative impact on the Student’s emotional well-being and sense of safety at the school.

In a decision that supported the out—of-district placement of a bullied child, the coutt stated “. .. bullies
generally do not stop on their own; even “intensive interventions” are often not effective when they are not
begun until after a course of harassment has continued for some time ...” Shore Regional High School Bd.
of Educ. v. PS, 381 F.3d 194 (8/20/04) The removal to an out-of—district placement was premised on the
belief that the school would not be able to keep the student safe from the offending peers who would
continue to be in the student’s classes and grade. (Id). It certainly stands to reason that if late action is
rarely successful in stopping bullying, then no action must certainly assure that bullying will certainly
continue.

The Principal of the Student, after being shown documentation to that effect, testiﬁed that he was aware of
the incident where students wrote derogatory and sexually harassing comments on the Student’s locker; he
was aware that the Student’s father had made numerous complaints that his daughter was being bullied and
sexually harassed; and that the Student spent a large po1tion of the year outside his ofﬁce during the lunch

period rather than having lunch with her peers.

The Principal stated that he investigated, or at least thought he did, but did not produce any evidence of the
investigation or the results from such an investigation.

The Board did not present any evidence of investigations for any of the complaints made by the Student

regarding bullying or sexual harassment, with the exception of a Video of a bus incident that resulted in the
Student and a peer being suspended. The parties agreed that the sound quality of the Video was too chaotic
and confused to allow for conclusions to be drawn from the Video. There was no written evidence from that i
incident or any other introduced into evidence.

There was nothing presented by the Board to show that they took steps to prevent the re-occun‘ence of the
derogatmy and sexually harassing language from being targeted at the Student, or any other student for that

matter, in the future.

The Student’s peers from the seventh and eighth grades would also be moving on to the same high school as
the Student for the 2012-2013 academic years.

The behaviors of the Student changed as the allegations of bullying and sexual harassment continued without
intervention. The Student became both aggressive physically and verbally; she became self—abusive and
threatened suicide; she demonstrated clinically signiﬁcant indicators to be diagnosed with a Major
Depressive Disorder and she became totally school avoidant.

There was no concrete evidence refuting the Student’s claims of bullying and sexual harassment; there was
no investigatory reports provided reﬁJting her claims; the principal acknowledged the existence of the
derogatory and sexually harassing terms put on the Student’s locker even though he never looked at them;
and the Board never presented any evidence that they took concrete steps to identify the harassers or to
prevent such behavior from occurring again.

The Student’s complaints of harassment for the Valentine’s Day dance and for the incident with the locker
are tacitly acknowledged to have occurred by the Board’s witnesses, even though they did not create a record
pro 01‘ con of their investigations or identify any of the harassing students.

The Student stopped coming to school in May, 2011 and has not returned since, citing harassment and
feeling unsafe in the school environment as the causes.

All of the Board’s witnesses testiﬁed that they did not believe that the Student was bullied or sexually
harassed. It was alluded to by several witnesses that the Student herself was the problem with her peers.

If that was the belief of the Board, then it stands that they should have recognized that this was a Student
who was acting outside of the norm and that there had to be some precipitant, either psychological or
otherwise, that would cause such behavior.

If it tmly was the belief of the Board that these incidents did not occur as buliying behaviors, when they were
presented with the constant perspective of the Student and the Parents that this was indeed happening, they
owed it to this Student to seek the truth It is incredulous that the Board did not ﬁnd that this situation was
exactly what 34 CFR. §300.301(a)(1) addresses. Under IDEA a Board may be required to consider special
factors in the development of a student‘s IEP. Among the special factors in the case of a student whose
behavior impedes his 01‘ her learning or that of others, the Board shall consider positive behavioral
interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(i); 34
CFR 300.324(a)(2)(i)

Certainly the Student was presenting behaviors that were interfering with her learning and possibly the
learning of other students. The Board addressed the behavior punitively with suspensions, and when the
Student stopped coming to school, they simply ignored that she was no longer there. There was no
consideration of questioning if the Student’s disabilities had some contributing factor to the situation.

The Student has shown that the bullying and sexually harassing behaviors impeded her educational beneﬁts,
and because of this, was denied a F APE.

Each public agency must ensure that a continuum of alternative placements is available to meet the needs of
children with disabilities including special schools. 34 CFR. §300.115. At no time were alternative
placements explored for the Student despite her continued academic, social and behavioral difﬁculties, the
request of the Parents to consider therapeutic placements and the recommendation of the neuropsychologist
that she be placed in a therapeutic school.

October 4, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12—0363

98. Predetermination by a school Board prevents Parents from having a meaningful opportunity to participate
and amounts to a denial of a FAPE. Shore Regional High School Bd. of Educ. v. RS, 381 F .3d 194
(8/20/04). In Deal the sixth Circuit found that the district had pre-decided not to offer a student intensive
ABA services “regardless of any evidence concerning [the student’s] individual needs and the effectiveness
of his private program.” 1d. A ﬁnding of predetermination was concluded despite the fact that the Parents
were allowed to attend PPT meetings and voice their opinions. Id. In Plainville Bd. of Educ, 52 IDELR 27,
(12/26/08) a school district was found to have denied a FAPE to a student for considering only one option at
a PPT, failing to consider school avoidance, transitions, and other student needs as well as ignoring the
recommendations of the treating clinician and outside neurological evaluation in creating the program.

99. In the matter of Ms, C. ex rel. N.L. v. Knox County Schools, 315 F.3d 688 (6“1 Cir. 2003) the court
emphasized school ofﬁcials are permitted to form opinions and compile repelts prior to IEP meetings (Knox
at 693-4 n.3). The court cautioned, however that such conduct is only harmless as long as school ofﬁcials
are “willing to listen to the Parents.” Id, at 694-5 (noting that school system representatives should “come to
the meeting with suggestions and open minds, not a required course of action.”

100. The Board did not appear to come to the PPT meetings with an “open mind” but instead with “a required
course of action.”

101.A]1 0f the Board staff admitted to not having considered any option other than the public school. The Special
Education Coordinator testiﬁed that she never considered outplacement because she felt the teacher’s reports
and present levels of performance showed that the Board had an appropriate program.

102. The Special Education Coordinator was speciﬁcally called in by the Board to handle the Student’s case. She
testiﬁed that she reviewed the Student’s ﬁle and was familiar with the program offered by the Board, and
was aware of the concerns raised by the teaching staff, the Student’s grades, the CMT scores, the discipline
reports, the increasing behaviors, and the school avoidant behavior yet she could not recall many of the
Student’s disabilities.

103. The Special Education Coordinator was aware of the letters from the treating clinician and the attending
psychiatrist but stated that the Team did not agree with the diagnosis because the school personnel were not
part of the discussion which formulated them.

104. Boards of Education cannot simply ignore the information from a Student’s treating clinician in determining
what program and placement a student requires. Fairﬁeld Board 0fEduc., 109 LRP 53093 (May 1 1, 2007)

105. The Board ignored the information from the Student’s treating clinician and supervising psychiatrist in
formulating the subsequent program and services because it did not accept the diagnosis, yet the Board did
nothing to obtain their own diagnosis or to reﬁJte the one provided by the clinicians.

106. This Student needed a reevaluation for it was clear that no matter how well intended the Board’s program
may have been, it was failing in providing this Student a FAPE. The evaluation did not occur until the
Parents took it upon themselves to provide a reevaluation of their daughter and the Board summarily
dismissed the evaluation.

107. The IEP created for the 2012—2013 academic years carried forth the same goals and objectives that the
11/29/1 1 IEP had, which is the same as the 6/10/11 IEP, which is the same as the 6/7/10 IEP.

October 4, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0363

108. After not being present in the school for over a year, receiving none of the sewices and program called for in
her IEP it is inconceivable that the Board would suggest that this Student has not only progressed but done so
sufﬁciently to pass not only the seventh grade where she missed more than one—quarter’s worth of days and
instruction and was close to failing all of her classes when she ﬁnally stopped going to school, but to also
pass the eighth grade where she missed the entire year and received NONE of her required services and
programs.

109. The Board would have the Student and the Parents believe that after receiving tutoring for the equivalent of
1.5 days of school a week for maximum of perhaps 52 weeks, or 78 days, the Student has been provided a
sufﬁcient program to pass the eighth grade despite all of the Student’s disabilities and not receiving any of
the services speciﬁed in her [ER

1 10. The Board was unwilling to accept Independent Neuropsychologist’s evaluation and recommendations yet
they had done nothing to obtain that information on their own

1 1 1.The triennial evaluation, which was made a part of the 6/7/ 10 IEP and due to be completed by 6/19/1 1, has
not yet been completed or even scheduled.

1 12. Without having a reevaluation and by dismissing the worthiness of the evaluation by Independent
Neuropsychologist, the Board approached all of the IEP’S since June 2011 blindly. Any measure proposed
or instituted was an estimation of what this child needed, not an empirically based determination. “No case
stands for the proposition that an IEP could be adequate where it does not provide for teaching techniques
required by the child.” SA. Riverside-De/anco Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ, 45 IDELR 215 (D.N.J. 2006)

1 13.11" a parent obtains an independent educational evaluation at public expense or shares with the public agency
an evaluation obtained at private expense, the results of the evaluation “must be considered by the public
agency, if it meets agency criteria, in any decision made with respect to the provision of a FAPE to the
child.” 34 C.F.R. §300.502(c), 20 USC. §§1415(b)(1) and (d)(2)(A). The Board did not present evidence
that the neuropsychological and psychological evaluation completed by Independent Neuropsychologist did
not meet agency criteria with the exception of the social/emotional ﬁndings. The Board’s witnesses testiﬁed
that the ﬁndings of the evaluation were similar to what was being presented in school. The school
psychologist stated the assessments used that were normed were appropriate to be utilized and he presented
no evidence that Independent Neuropsychologist’s clinical ﬁndings were inaccurate.

1 14. The Board has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the program and placement that
they offered the Student was appropriate, they have not satisﬁed their burden. The failure of the Board to
reevaluate the Student or to more appropriately incorporate the neuropsychological and psychological
evaluation ﬁndings into the subsequent IEP’s has impeded the Student’s right to a FAPE and has caused a
deprivation of educational beneﬁts.

115. The Parents asked for an out of district educational placement, two years of compensatory education and
reimbursement for the independent neuropsychological and psychological evaluation. The Board denied the
request.

116. The second prong 0f Rowley requires a ﬁnding that the IEP is “reasonably calculated to enable the child to
receive educational benefits.” Board ofEducation 0f the Hendrick Hudson Central School Dirtrict v. Rowley,
458 US. 176, 206, 207 (1982). The IDEA requires only that school districts provide an “appropriate” IEP,
gauged by whether the IEP is “sufﬁcient to confer some educational beneﬁt.” 1d,, at 200; see also Mrs. B. v.

October 4, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12—0363
Milford Board ofEducation, 103 FM 1 114, l 120 (2d Cir. 1997). An appropriateeducation under IDEA is
one that is likely to produce progress, not regression. Walczak v. Florida Union Free School District, 27
IDELR 1135 (2d Cir. 1998)

1 17. The objective data that has been presented previously in this Decision suggests that the Student has not
progressed To the extent that the Board continues to reject the evaluation of Independent
Neuropsychologist, it still has not conducted a reevaluation of the Student in violation of 34 C.F.R.
§3001303(b)(2). This fact alone makes the IEP created on June 26, 2012 faulty because it fails to ensure that
the Student has been assessed in all areas related to the suspected disability in violation of IDEA. 34 C.F.R.

(3300.309

1 18. The required behavioral plan that the June, 2011 IEP called for has not yet been created. Positive behavioral
interventions, supports and other strategies must be considered by the PPT when a student’s behaviors
impede his 01‘ her learning 01' the learning of those around him 01‘ her. 34 CPR. §300.324 (a)(2)(i). The
assistive technology evaluation has not been completed.

1 1 9. Despite the consistent struggles this disabled student has had the Board has never offered or provided
speciﬁc evaluations in Mathematics, Reading or Writing. These failures prevent the Student from receiving

a FAPE.
1 20. The school district must consider ESY services through a PPT.

121. 34 CPR. §300.106 states: (a) General. (1) Each public agency must ensure that extended school year
sewices are available as necessary to provide FAPE, consistent with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) Extended school year services must be provided only if a child's IEP Team determines, on an individual
basis, in accordance with §§ 300.320 through 300.324, that the sewices are necessary for the provision of
FAPE to the child.
(3) In implementing the requirements of this section, a public agency may not~—
(i) Limit extended school year services to particular categories of disability; or
(ii) Unilaterally limit the type, amount, or duration of those services.
(b) Deﬁnition. As used in this section, the term extended school year services means special education and
related services thatw—
(1) Are provided to a child with a disability—
(iii) Beyond the normal school year of the public agency;
(iv) In accordance with the child‘s IEP; and
(v) At no cost to the Parents of the Child; and
(2) Meet the standards of the SEA.

122. There is no evidence that ESY services were ever considered or discussed. 34C.F.R.§300.324(b)(ii)(A—E)
requires that the Team address anticipated problems that the Student may have, lack of progress shown,
issues identiﬁed by the Parents 01' evaluations provided. Between the summers of the seventh and eighth
grade, and then the eighth and ninth grades at a minimum, with the Student not having been in school for an
extended period of time and not having resolved any of the bullying and sexual harassment issues for the
Student, the Team should have anticipated that there would be regression across academics and
social/emotional issuesi Extended school year services would have been intended to address those issues.
The Team should have, at the very least, discussed and resolved if ESY services were warranted,
documenting the results and reasons therefore.

29

October 4, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0363

123. The failure to do so for the June, 2011 and June 2012 IEP’s is a denial of the Student’s right to a FAPE, a
denial of the Parents’ right to paiticipate fully, and a denial of education beneﬁts to the Student.

124. CompensatOIy education is the “replacement of educational sewices the child should have received in the
first place” and should “elevate [the Student] to the position he would have occupied absent the school
board’s failures.” Reid ex rel. Reid v. Board ofColumbia, 401 F. 3d 516,518, 524-27 (DC. Cir. 2005)

125. Compensatory education has been recognized as an available remedy under IDEA for failure of the Board to
provide FAPE. See, KP v. Juzwic, 891 F.Supp. 703 (D.Conn. 1995); Burr v, Amback, 863 F.2d 1071 (2d
Cir. 1988)

126. Hearing Ofﬁcers have the authority to provide compensatory education as an equitable remedy for denial of
FAPE. Student v, Greenwich B.O.E.. CT. DOE Case No. 06-005 at 19; Inquiry of Kohn, 17 EHLR 522
(OSEP) (2/13/91)(citing with approval Lester H. v. Gilhaol, 916 F.2d 865 (3d Cir. 1990)

127. Placement of a child is paramount to the central tenets of IDEA. “Because the law expresses a strong
preference for children with disabilities to be educated “to the maximum extent appropriate,’ together with
their non—disabled peers, 20 U.S.C. §1412(5), special education and related services must be provided in the
least restrictive setting consistent with a child’s needs. Only “when the nature or severity “of a child’s
disability is such that “education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and sewices cannot be
achieved satisfactorily” should a child be segregated.” Walzak, supra (citations omitted)

128. School districts must evaluate whether a student can be educated in a regular classroom if provided with
supplemental aids and services, and a full range of services must be considered. Oberti v. Board of
Education, 995 F.2d 1204, 1216 (3d Cir. 1993)

129. The Board has demonstrated that they cannot, or will not; educate this Student in a regular or collaborative
setting. This Student needs to be placed outside of the Board’s setting to allow her to re-coup what she has
been denied.

130. The Board sent records to three therapeutic schools, High Road School, Grace Webb and CCMC; doing so
as an accepted resolution to the Parents Motion for Emergency Interim Relief (which was then withdrawn by
the Parents). The Board was clear that they were not supporting placement in any of these therapeutic
schools, thus precluding acceptance by any of these schools.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
1. The Board did not provide a FAPE to the Student for the 2010-2011 academic years.
2. The Board did not provide a FAPE to the Student for the 2011-2012 academic years.

3. The Board did not propose a program for the 2012—201 3 academic years that would provide the Student
with a FAPE.

4. The Board will place the Student in a therapeutic day-treatment program for two years that will provide a

program consistent with 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 IEP’S that incorporates the relevant parts of
Independent Neuropsychologist’s evaluation and recommendations and provides a FAPE to the Student.

October 4, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0363

5. Within two weeks of receipt of this Final Decision and Order the Board will meet with the Parents and/or
Parent’s legal counsel to create a new 2012-2013 IEP for this Student reﬂecting this decision and order.

6. Placement will be made, if space is immediately (within one week) available, from one of the three
therapeutic schools suggested by the Parents; if space is not immediately available from one of the three
schools suggested by the Parents, the PPT Team will immediately provide the Parents with a list of
alternative therapeutic day schools that the Board will provide placement t0.

7. The Board will provide transition assistance through its school social workers to the Student and Parents to
assure rapid placement and transition counseling, if needed.

8. The Board will assure that the 2012-2013 and 2013—2014 IEP’s contain ESY services for both IEP’s,
inclusive of after school programming if available at the day 01' community placement that will touch on

the issues of GLBT for adolescents, social skills and conﬂict resolution.

9. The Board will reimburse the Parents for the cost of the independent neuropsychological and psychological
conducted by Independent Neuropsychologist.
