   The prehearing conference in this matter was conducted on August 18, 2004 at a time 

selected by the parties, with a date for mailing of the final decision of September 27, 
2004.  The parties mutually requested an extension of this date and the Student&#8482;s counsel 
expressly agreed to provide the hearing officer with certain records on or before August 23, 2004, along with a request to extend the 45 day period.  She did neither.  When the 
hearing officer faxed the parties a notice assigning a new hearing date and explaining that the date was to allow for completion within the 45 day period, the parties notified her that 
the matter had been settled.  
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The matter is 
DISMISSED.
