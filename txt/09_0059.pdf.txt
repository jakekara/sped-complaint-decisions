 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  (October 17, 2008)  
This matter was commenced by request 
for due process dated July 26, 2008 by the Parents on behalf of the Student, who was described as a high school student with autism.  Assuming that the Board received
 the due process complaint on July 26, 20008, the date for mailing of the Final Decision 
and Order would have been October 14, 2008 (absent modification by the Hearing Officer). 
 
The due process complaint alleged a denial 
of a FAPE within the meaning of the  
Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400, 
et. seq. (the &#64257;IDEIA&#64258;), with respect to the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 school years.  The 
undersigned was assigned as Hearing Officer by notice dated July 28, 2008.  After commencing this due process proceeding, the Parents retained Mr. Klebanoff as counsel.  In response to a request of the Hearing Officer to convene a pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) for August 14, 2008, the Student&#8482;s counsel advised that his office was not 
prepared to proceed with a PHC as it had only just been retained and did not have records 
that had previously been requested from the Bo
ard.  Both parties reported that they had agreed to pursue a mediation and agreed to
 defer convening the PHC at that time.  On 
September 6, 2008, the parties reported that a
lthough they had agreed to two mediation 
dates in late September they had been a
dvised that the Department had no mediators 

available on either date.  Counsel for the Board reported that the parties had agreed to convene an &#64257;informal resolution meeting&#64258; 
as well.  On September 23, 2008, the Hearing Officer was advised that a Department-sponsored mediati
on would convene on October 8, 2008.  By notice dated September 27, 2008, the H
earing Officer (1) directed that if the 
parties were unable to resolve their dispute through that mediation, a PHC would be 
convened on October 14, 2008 and (2) extended the date for mailing of the Final
