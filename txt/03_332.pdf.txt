Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   SUMMARY:   The matter was assigned on October 10, 2003.  A prehearing conference was 
scheduled for October 17.  On the day before the prehearing conference, the Parent left a voice mail message for the undersigned hearing 
officer which indicated that she did not want to proceed with the hearing at this time.  No Notice to Withdraw the case was 
received prior to the prehearing, and the voice mail message was inappropriate 
ex parte communication.  At the prehearing conference, Attorney Laubin was present for the 

Board, but the Parent was not available.  Attorney Laubin reported that the Parent had not contacted the Board regarding the status of the prehearing or the Parent&#8482;s intention to withdraw the case. Based on the Parent&#8482;s voice mail message, and her failure to be 
available for the scheduled prehearing conference, this matter is dismissed, without 

prejudice.    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:   The matter is 
DISMISSED, without prejudice.
