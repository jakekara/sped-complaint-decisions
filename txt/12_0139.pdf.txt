FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education
(F APE) as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et
seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-763. At a PPT meeting, the Parent rejected the program offered by the
Board for the 201 1~2012 school year. The Parent requested a residential program at Chamberlin School in
Massachusetts. The Board refused the Parent’s request. On or about October 5, 2011, the Board received notice of
the Parent’s request for due process. The parties agreed to go to mediation in place of a t'eso1ution meeting.

An impartial hearing officer was appointed on October 13, 201 1 and a pre-hearing conference was held on
October 19, 201 1. Hearing dates of December 13 and 15, 201 1 were chosen by the paities.

In an electronic transmission, the Parent’s attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties were able to
resolve the matter in mediation and that additional time was needed to c1arify the agreement. In a letter from the
Parent’s attorney the hearing ofﬁcer was notified that the agreement had been ratiﬁed and that the matter could be
withdrawn with prej udice.

The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the patties’
mediation and the hearing date. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is February 17, 2012

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
