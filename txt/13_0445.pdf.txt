FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Did the New Britain Board of Education (“Board”) deny the Student 21 free and
appropriate public education (“FAPE”) in the 4/12/2013 Individual Education
Program (“IEP”) because it was created without parental input and does not
provide the Student with the least restrictive environment (“LRE”)?

2. Does the 4/12/2013 IEP deny the Student a F APE because it fails to maintain the
Student at the Options Educational Services (“Options”) placement?

3. Does the 4/12/2013 IEP fail to provide the Student a FAPE because it does not
include an extended school year (“ESY”) for the 2013 -2014 summer period?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This matter was filed on April 26, 2013. A pre-hearing conference was held on May 20,
2013, where the issues stated above were identiﬁed. A due process hearing date was set
for July 9, 2013 to accommodate scheduling conﬂicts for counsel. A request to extend
the ﬁnal decision date from July 10, 2013 for thirty days was granted on July 2, 2013. At
that point the ﬁnal decision and order date was extended to August 9, 2013. The parties
were given a series of dates for re-scheduling the hearing date from July 9, 2013,
however the patties could not come to agreement on a date and time for the hearing to
occur. On July 3, 2013, Counsel for the Parents withdrew the complaint, via an email to
the hearing ofﬁcer, without prejudice.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

Counsel for the Parents, via writing, withdrew the complaint for due process without
prejudice. Having no further issues to be resolved, this matter is DISMISSED without

prejudice.
