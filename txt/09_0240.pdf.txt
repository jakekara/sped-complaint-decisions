 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  A special education hearing in the above-captioned matter was requested by the Student 
via letter dated December 2, 2008.  
It was received by the Board of Education on December 2, 2008.  The 30-day resolution period ran through January 1, 2009.  The deadline for mailing the 
final decision and order was February 15, 2009. A pre-hearing conference was held on December 22, 2008.  The parties agreed that a 
resolution session was critical and that it could not be convened prior to the end of the resolution period due to the winter holidays and school vacation schedule.  The Student requested a forty-five day extension of the deadline for mailing a fina
l decision to permit the parties to engage in a 
resolution session.  The request for an extensi
on of the mailing date was granted after full 
consideration of the positions of the parties.  The deadline fo
r mailing the final decision and 
order was extended until March 31, 2009.  ISSUES: 1. Did the Board of Education improperly fail 
to identify Student as a child eligible 
for special education services?
