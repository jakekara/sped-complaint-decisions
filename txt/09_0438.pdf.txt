 ISSUES:  1. Are the actions of the Student that caused him to be
 suspended by the District a manifestation of his 
disability? 
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
:   The Student is a 14 years and 7 month young man w
ho is identified as entitled  to receive a free and 
appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 
U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. At a PPT meeting the Board suspended the Student from school. The Parent objected to this finding
 and requested that the Board identify the Student&#8482;s 
actions as a manifestation of his disability.  The Board 
denied the Parent&#8482;s request and the Parent filed for due 
process.   On or about May 4, 2009 the Board received notice of
 the Parent&#8482;s request for due process. An impartial 
hearing officer was appointed on May 4, 2009 and a pre-hearing conference was held on May 12, 2009.  

 At the pre-hearing conference the Board informed th
e hearing officer that the Parent had agreed to withdraw the matter without prejudice as the parties were
 working to resolve the issue. In a letter from the 
Parent&#8482;s attorney the hearing officer
 was informed that the Parent was requesting a withdrawal of the matter 
without prejudice. The withdrawal without prejudice is granted. 

  The date for the mailing of the Fina
l Decision and Order is June 28, 2009. 
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
  THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
