General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents
rejected the Board’s ﬁnding that the Student was not eligible to receive special education and
i'e1ated services. The Parents requested that the Student be identiﬁed as eligible to receive special
education and related services. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On July 13, 2016, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. An impartial
hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on July 18, 2016 and a pre-hearing conference was held on July
