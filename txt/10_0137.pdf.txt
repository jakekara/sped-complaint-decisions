2. Does the program at Kildonan School provide the Stude

3. Should the Board reimburse the Parents for their unilateral placement of the Student at the Kildonan School? 
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
: The Student has been identified as Spee
ch and Language Impaired and is entitle
d to receive a free and appropriate public education as defined in the Individuals with Di
sabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and 
Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a.  
The Student&#8482;s Parents rejected the Board&#8482;s IEP for the 
2009-2010 school-year. The Parents sought placement of the 
Student at the Kildonan School. The Board rejected the Pare
nt&#8482;s request. On or about October 5, 2009, the Board 
received notice that the Parent&#8482;s were requesting a Due Pro
cess hearing. On or about October 5, 2009, an impartial 
special education officer was appointed to hear the matte
r. The parties mediated the matter rather than attend a 
resolution session. At the October 14, 2009 pre-hearing conf
erence the parties agreed to a January 11, 2010 hearing 
date. As a result of the discussions, on or about December 22, 2009
 the Parents sent a facsimile transmission to the hearing 
officer advising him that the matter had been settled and 
requested a withdrawal with prejudice. The request for 
withdrawal of the due process request with prejudice was granted.  
At the request of the parties, in order to accommodate the ma
iling of a final decision and order after the hearing date, the 
date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was ex
tended. The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and 
Order is February 12, 2010. 
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: 
THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
