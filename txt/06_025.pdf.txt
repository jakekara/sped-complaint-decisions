of the services?  PROCEDURAL HISTORY  On January 26, 2006the parent through their attorney requested due process.  At a 
prehearing conference on February 9, 2006 the attorney for the LEA (local education

process which was ruled to be sufficient by the hearing officer.  At a hearing on May 28, 
2006 new counsel in the matter requested leave to pursue mediation.  At the scheduled 

hearing the parties report they believe they have an agreement.  No additional dates are 

set for hearing in the matter.  The matter is dismissed without prejudice.
