  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   This proceeding was commenced by the St
udent, who is 19 years old, by a request 
dated February 9, 2006 directed to and received on or about February 9, 2006 by the Hartford Public Schools (the &#64257;Board&#64258;), and received by the State of Connecticut, Department of Education Due Process Unit on February 17, 2006.   The Student alleges 

that the Board failed to timely and properly implement certain aspects of an IEP 

developed at a PPT meeting convened on November 28, 2005, as detailed more fully in 

the Student&#8482;s request for a hearing.  For purposes of this final decision and order, the Board is deemed to have 
received the Student&#8482;s request for due process on February 9, 2006.  In scheduling the 
telephonic pre-hearing conference, the Hearing Officer was advised separately by each party that the parties had settled their dispute and were completing a written settlement 

agreement.  By order dated March 17, 2006, a PHC was scheduled for March 29, 2006 in 

the event that the settlement was not finalized as anticipated.  To the extent that this 

matter was resolved prior to the scheduled PHC, the parties were to report to the Hearing 

Officer.  On March 28, 2006, counsel for the Student reported that the parties had 
executed a settlement agreement resolving this matter, which was being withdrawn by the 

Student.  Accordingly, this matter is dismissed.
