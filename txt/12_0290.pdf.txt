This hearing was requested by Parent on February 14, 2012. The Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on
February 16, 2012. The original date for mailing the decision was April 30, 2012.

By letter dated February 20, 2012, the Board moved to strike some of the issues included in the request
for hearing. The Hearing Ofﬁcer responded on February 23, 2012, striking issues that were outside of
her jurisdiction and proposing issues to be discussed at the pre-hearing conference.

Included in the request for hearing was a request for an order concerning Student’s “stay put” status
pending the conclusion of the hearing, pursuant to 34 C.F.R. §300.518 (a) and Section 10-7611—17,
Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. The Hearing Ofﬁcer responded on February 24, 2012,
ordering that the Student’s placement at ECDS be supported by the Board pending the conclusion of this
hearing,

A pre-hearing conference was held on March 1, 2012. At that time, the Parties reported that they had
agreed to waive the resolution meeting and request mediation from the State Department ofEducation.
The issues developed at this conference were modiﬁed and agreed to on March 3, 2012, and revised
again on March 30, 2012.

The hearing was scheduled for March 27 and April 1 1, 12 and 25, 2012. The hearing convened on
March 27 and April 11 and 12,2012. On April 12, the Patties agreed to: 1) switch hearing dates with
this student’s sibling’s hearing dates; 2) request an extention of the decision date from April 30 to May
30, 2012; and 3) ﬁle briefs in lieu of closing arguments at the conclusion of the hearing.

The April 25 hearing session was cancelled and hearing sessions for May 3 and 21 were scheduled. The
decision date was extended to June 29 to accommodate the brieﬁng schedule. On May 1, the Hearing

Ofﬁcer postponed the hearing session to July 16, 2012. To accommodate this change, the decision date
was extended to August 24, 2012.

postponement because of a court date on July 16. The Hearing Ofﬁcer granted this postponement and
