SUMMARY:  The matter was assigned on May 20, 2002, and a prehearing conference was held on May 23.  The hearing convened on June 11, with counsel present for the Boards, and the Surrogate Parent proceeding pro se.  All parties confirmed that the sole issue for this hearing was which Board was responsible for the education of the Student, who is currently identified as eligible for special education and related services.  All parties also confirmed at the hearing that the Student is currently receiving special education services from the Westport Board, and that the Student would continue to receive these services while the determination of the nexus town for the Student is pending.  On the basis of these stipulations, both Board counsel moved to dismiss this matter for lack of jurisdiction.
