Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUE:  Whether the Board is required to provide transportation to the Student to the Explorations 
School.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  The Parent requested this hearing on December 1, seeking to continue the Student&#8482;s 

transportation to attend the Explorations School in Winsted.  In the hearing request, the 
Parent sought to overturn the decision of the Board to terminate the transportation to 
Explorations School, and challenged that the decision was a change of education 
placement for the Student. 
 A prehearing conference was held on December 8, and a hearing date was scheduled for 

January 6.  This hearing was subsequently postponed to January 7 due to inclement 
weather.    The Parent submitted a request for stay put on December 10.  The parties were requested 
to submit any exhibits and/or affidavits regarding the current status of the Student&#8482;s 
program by December 17.  The Parent and the Board submitted documents and exhibits 
in response to this request.                                                   1 Initially the Father brought this action.  Both Parents appeared at the hearing to report that the case had been settled.
