FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1‘ Is the program provided by the Board for the 2014-2015 school year appropriate and does it
provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE)?

2. Does the program at Ben Bronz Academy offer the Student FAPE in the LRE?

3. Is the Student entitled to compensatory education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as Speech and Language Impaired and is entitled to receive FAPE as
deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq.
and Connecticut General Statute §10-763 et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the
Parent rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2014—2015 school year. The Parent requested
that the Student be placed at Ben Bronz Academy. The Board refused the Parent’s request.

On September 6, 2014, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request for due process. The parties
agreed to waive a resolution session and go to mediation. The date of the mediation was September 22,
2014. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on September 9, 2014 and a pre—hearing conference
was held on September 16, 2014. A hearing date of September 28, 2014 was chosen by the parties.

On September 25, 2014, in an electronic transmission, the Parent’s attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer
that the panies were able to resolve the matter but needed additional time to ratify the agreement. The
Parent’s attorney requested that the matter be withdrawn without prejudice. The Board agreed with the
Parent’s attorney’s request. The withdrawal was granted. The date for mailing the Final Decision and
Order is November 20, 2014.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the

ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance With the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
