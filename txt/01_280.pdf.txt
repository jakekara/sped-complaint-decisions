October 12, 2001 -2- Final Decision and Order 01-280 ISSUES:  1. Does the placement offered by the Board for the 2001-2002 academic year for the Student satisfy the requirements of the IDEA that the Student be provided a free and appropriate education at public expense in the least restrictive environment?   2. If not, is the Connecticut Center for Child Development (&#64257;CCCD&#64258;) an appropriate placement for the Student for the 2001-2002 academic year?  PROCEDURAL SUMMARY: The Parents, who appeared pro se, seek a determination as to their son&#8482;s (the &#64257;Student&#8482;s&#64258;) placement for the 2001-2002 academic year.  At the September 5, 2001 Pre-Hearing Conference, hearing was scheduled for September 28, October 3 and October 4, 2001.     At that time , the Parents raised concerns regarding the Board&#8482;s compliance with the IDEA &#64257;stay-put&#64258; requirements, 20 U.S.C.  1415(j).  At hearing on September 28, 2001, the parties reported that &#64257;stay-put&#64258; issues had been resolved.     Between them, the parties identified 18 potential witnesses for hearing.   Given the number of potential witnesses, it was anticipated that hearing would continue past October 4, 2001 and that the October 5, 2001 date for mailing the final decision would be adjusted accordingly.   For the reasons set forth more fully below, the hearing concluded on October 3, 2001.  The parties agreed to extend the date for mailing of the final decision until and including October 11, 2001 to permit the Hearing Officer an adequate opportunity to prepare that decision.  On September 28, 2001, the Board reported that it had been advised by CCCD that CCCD currently had no openings for a child of the Student&#8482;s age; and, further, that even assuming a space became available at CCCD for a child of the Student&#8482;s age, admission was not certain as CCCD would need to evaluate the Student, a process which could involve reviewing a videotape of the Student&#8482;s current functioning.  Given this development, the parties agreed to discuss settlement of their disputes prior to the scheduled October 3, 2001 hearing date.     On October 2, 2001, the Board&#8482;s counsel advised the Hearing Officer that the parties had been unable to reach a settlement and that the Board planned to stipulate (and had advised the Parents that it would stipulate): (1) that the educational program it had offered to the Student for the 2001-2002 academic year was not appropriate to meet the Student&#8482;s educational needs; and, (2) that CCCD was an appropriate placement for the Student in the 2001-2002 academic year.  The Board conceded that entering these stipulations in the circumstances of this case would result in the Student remaining in an in-district placement and leave unresolved Parental concerns regarding such a placement.  The Board indicated a willingness to continue efforts to identify an appropriate out-of-district placement for the Student for the 2001-2002 academic year.       Prior to going on the record on October 3, 2001, the parties confirmed that they had been unable to identify an alternative out-of-the-district placement for the Student in the short
