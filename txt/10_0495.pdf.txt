Attorney Mary
 Elizabeth Oppenheim, Hearing Officer FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
ISSUES: 1.Whether the Board&#8482;s proposed program for the St
udent for the 2010-11 school year is appropriate. 2.If not, whether the Student shall be
 placed in a specialized school for children with autism that meets 
the Student&#8482;s behavioral objectives in a clinical setting. 
SUMMARY: The Board received this request for hearing on 
June 17, 2010 and prehearing conferences convened on 
June 28, 2010. At the prehearing conference, the Parent 
informed the hearing officer and the Board attorney 
that she did not want to proceed with the hearing, but
 wanted to proceed with mediation only.  The Parent 
indicated that she would submit notifi
cation in writing via email, but that 
notification was not received.  Based on the representations during the prehearing conference, it is found that the Parent solely wants to proceed with mediation and does not want to prosecute this acti
on.  This matter will be dismissed without prejudice so 
that the Parent can re-file if she does not resolve the issues in mediation.   
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: 
The matter is 
DISMISSED, without prejudice.
