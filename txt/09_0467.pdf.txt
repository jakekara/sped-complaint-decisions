 The parties participated in a mediation of this case on June 
23, 2009 and the Parents&#8482; attorney submitted notification on June 26, 2009 
that the parties had reached an 
oral agreement and that they 
were attempting to reduce the agreem
ent to writing.  Based on this notif
ication, the hearing officer sent 
Requests for Status to the parties on June 30, 2009 and July 7, 2009 to determine whether the parties 
had finalized the settlement.  In response to this 
request for status, the parties requested that the 
hearing dates of July 14, 2009 and July 15, 2009 be cancelled so that the settlement
 could be finalized.
