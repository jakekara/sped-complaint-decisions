Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a? FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
: The Student has not been identified as entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in IDEA 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. The Surrogate Parent rejected the PPT finding that the Student was not eligible for special 
education and related services. The 
Surrogate Parent requested that the St
udent be identified as eligible for sp
ecial education and related services. The Board refused the Surrogate Parent&#8482;s request. On or about May 6, 2010, the Board received notice of the Surrogate Parent&#8482;s request for due process. Mediati
on was scheduled for July 7, 2010. An impartial hearing 
officer was appointed on May 7, 2010 and a pre-hearing conference was held on May 24, 2010. A hearing date of June 29, 2010 was chosen by the parties. In an electronic transmittal, the Su
rrogate Parent requested that the June 29, 2010 be postponed due to the July 7, 2010 mediation date. A hearing date of July
 23, 2010 was agreed to by the parties. The Surrogate Parent sent the hearing officer a le
tter withdrawing the request for due process without prejudice. There was no objection from the Board. In order to accommodate the mailing of a final decision and order after the 

hearing date, the date for the filing of the Final D
ecision and Order was extended. The date for the Final Decision and Order is August 3, 2010. 
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: 
THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
