Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUES  I. Whether the student is entitled to an independent evaluation at Board 
expense?  
  PROCEDURAL HISTORY  The local educational agency (LEA) requested due process on March 15, 2004.  The LEA denied the Parents&#8482; request for an independent education evaluation of their child at a March 11, 2004, Individualized Education Program (IEP) meeting.  The LEA  requested 
the due process hearing pursuant to 34 CFR &#167;300.502(2), to determine if the child is 
entitled to the requested evaluation claiming the Parents did not state the purpose or the 
type of evaluation they were seeking.   FINDINGS OF FACT  On April 5, 2004 the LEA requested an extension of the decision until June 1, 2004 to 
accommodate scheduling.  On April 30, 2004 the Parent requested postponement of the 
due process hearing.  (Exhibit HO-1).   On May 4, 2004, the record indicates the Parent withdrew their request for the independent evaluation by letter dated May 3, 2004.  (Exhibit HO- 3, Page 2 of 2) and did not appear at the hearing on May 4, 2004.
