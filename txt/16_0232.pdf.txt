PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On November 5, 2015, the Board received a Special Education Due Process Hearing Request ﬁled by
Attorney for the Parents and the Connecticut State Department of Education appointed this Hearing
Ofﬁcer to preside over the matter. During the prehearing conference held on November 17, 2015, a
hearing date of February 26, 2016 was set and the deadline for mailing the Final Decision and Order was
established as Monday, J anuary 19, 2016. An oral request for an extension of the mailing deadline was
made by Attorney for the Parents during the conference. The stated purpose of the extension request was
to allow the parties time to palticipate in settlement negotiations. This request was granted and a new
deadline for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was established as Febmai‘y 18, 2016. On
January 16, 2016, Counsel jointly requested that the original hearing date of February 26, 2016 be
postponed in order to let the parties paiticipate in a mediation which had been scheduled for February 29,
2016. After a consideration of all of the relevant factors, and after the parties provided a new hearing date
of March 28, 2016, this request was granted on February 3, 2016. The parties also jointly requested an
extension of the deadline for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order to March 17, 2016 which was
also granted on February 3, 2016. On February 29, 2016, Attorney for the Parents sent an email to the
