FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

Parents’ Issues:

1.

Was the Student correctly identiﬁed by the Board’s Planning and Placement Team
(PPT) as Other Health Impaired (0H1), based on diagnoses of ADHD and a Conduct

Disorder?

Did the Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) offered by the Board for the
Student, subsequent to a December 2010, diagnosis, for 2010-2011, Extended School
Year (ESY) 2011, and 2011-2012, provide for a free appropriate public education
(FAPE) for the Student?

If not, is the Connecticut Center for Child Development (CCCD) an appropriate
placement for the Student?

Is the Board responsible for reimbursing/funding placement at CCCD for the Student
for 2010-2011, ESY 201 1 and 20112012, upon receipt of appropriate
documentation?

Is the Board responsible for reimbursing the Parents for the documented cost of
evaluations of the Student by Dr, Meinhold and Ms. Rohdie?

Should the Student be awarded compensatory educational services?

September 16, 201 1 Final Decision and Order 12-0007

Board’s Issues:

7‘ Is the IEP for the 201 1—2012 school year ripe for hearing, in that the PPT has not yet
proposed an IEP or placement, pending the completion of evaluations?

8. Did the Parents refuse consent for evaluations requested by the PPT in December
2010, effectively denying the PPT access to information needed to develop
appropriate placement options for Student?
