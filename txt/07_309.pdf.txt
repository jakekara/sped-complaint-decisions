  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 
ISSUES

appropriate public education? 
II. Whether the parents fully cooperated in an evaluation of the child&#8482;s needs? 
  
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

 
The parent requested a due process hearing on September 28, 2007.  The parties 
requested time to attempt to reach a resolution and extended the date for mailing the final 

decision to permit time to discuss settlement and review the need for additional 

evaluations.  The first date of hearing was scheduled and the parties found they required additional time to determine whether they woul
d be able to reach a full agreement.  On 
the last day of hearing the parties believed they would reach agreement and believed they 
did not require any additional dates for hearing.  The matter was resolved within 45 days 
as extended by the parties to 
pursue settlement negotiations.
