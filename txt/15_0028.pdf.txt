FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Did the Board violate child ﬁnd by not identifying the Student as requiring special education and related
sewices as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) 20 U.S.C.
§l401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §lO-76a et seq.? If so;

2. Was the graduation of the Student appropriate?

3. Is the Student entitled to compensatory education for the denial of a free and appropriate public education
(FAPE)?

SUMMARY AND PRO CEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has not been identiﬁed as eligible to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) 20 U.S.C. §l401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq.
At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parent stated that the Board had violated child ﬁnd by not
ﬁnding the Student eligible for special education and related services. The Parent requested that the Student be
identiﬁed as eligible for special education and related services; the Board denied the Parent’s request. The
Parent requested a due process hearing. The Board received notice of the request on July 15, 2014. An
impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on July 15, 2014 and a pre-hearing conference was scheduled for July
22, 2014.

The parties agreed to forego a resolution meeting and proceed to mediation. The mediation occurred on
September 11, 2014 but was not successful. On September 16, 2014 the Board ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss the
Student’s request for due process; the Parent ﬁled a timely response to the Board’s motion. On September 18,
2015, the Board’s motion was denied. The parties agreed to an August 25, 2014 hearing date. This hearing date
was cancelled to accommodate the mediation. The hearing convened on November 5, 2014, January 6, 2015
and March 24, 2015. The panties also agreed to the following hearing dates: October 7, December 15, 2014,
January 9, 26 and 27, February 3, 6, 9, 10, 27, March 5, 6, 23, and 31, 2015. These dates were cancelled due to
medical issues, jury duty and inclement weather.

Through electronic mail, the Parent advised the hearing ofﬁcer that she no longer wanted to pursue the hearing

and asked that the matter be withdrawn with prejudice; the Board did not object. The date for the mailing of the
Final Decision and Order was extended to April 17, 2015 to accommodate the mediation and hearing dates.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing officer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing officer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Stamtes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
