PRO CEDURAL HISTORY:

This hearing was requested by Parents on March 14, 2012. The Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on March 16,
2012. The date for mailing the decision was May 28, 2012.

A pre—hearing conference was held on March 28, 2012. At that time, the Parties reported they had agreed to
waive the resolution meeting and request mediation from the State Department of Education. The mailing
date was extended to June 27, 2012 to provide for settlement negotiations. The hearing was scheduled for
May 23, 24, 29, 30 and 31, 2012. The dates of May 23, 24 and 29 were postponed on April 27 at the request
of the Patties. On May 25, the Parties requested that the May 30 and 31 hearing sessions be postponed and
the hearing was re-scheduled to June 13, 2012. On June 1 1, 2012, Parents’ Attorney notiﬁed the Hearing
Ofﬁcer that a settlement had been made through mediation, and the Parents had withdrawn their request for a
hearing. A11 motions and objections not previously ruled upon, if any, are hereby overruled.

In order to comply with the conﬁdentiality requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
of 1974, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g and related regulations at 34 CPR. § 99, the following decision uses “Student”,
“School”, “Parent” and titles of school staff members and other witnesses instead of names and other

personally identiﬁable information.
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

Because this matter has been settled and the request for hearing has been withdrawn, the case is
DISMISSED, with prejudice.
