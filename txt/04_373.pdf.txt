 FINAL ORDER AND DECISION  SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  The student is a 7 year old young boy who has been identified as Autistic and entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education as defined in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a.  The Parents rejected the 2004-2005 IEP and contended that the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 IEP did not provide the student with FAPE.  The Parents requested reimbursement 
for their placement of the student at Connecticut Center for Child Development and 
compensatory education. The Board rejected the Parents&#8482; request and the Parents 
requested  a Due Process Hearing On November 29, 2004, a Hearing officer was 
appointed.  A pre-hearing conference was held on December 6, 2004 and agreed upon hearing dates of February 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9, 

2005 were chosen by the parties.  At a later time the following hearing dates were also 
agreed to by the parties March 28, 30, April 13 and 14, 2005.  The hearing dates of February 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9, 2005 were cancelled at the request of the 
parties since the parties were attempting to settle the matter.  At the March 28, 2005 
hearing date, the parties informed the hearing officer that they needed a little time to 
complete an agreement. The parties then informed the hearing officer that an agreement 
had been reached and no further action was needed on the matter. On March 29, 2005 the 
Parents&#8482; attorney sent a facsimile transmi
ssion to the Hearing Officer withdrawing the hearing with prejudice. The date for the Final Order and Decision was extended by the parties to May 14, 2005. FINAL ORDER AND DECISION: THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
