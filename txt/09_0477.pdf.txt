 PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
  The Board&#8482;s attorney requested this hearing 
by mailing a letter dated May 21, 2009 to the State 
Department of Education, which was received on 
May 26, 2009.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to 
the case on that date.  On June 10, 2009 a prehearing 
conference was held with 
the Board&#8482;s attorney and 
the Mother.  The mailing date for the final decision wa
s set at July 6, 2009.  The Board offered mediation 
or a resolution meeting, but the Parent wanted to ha
ve an attorney represent her before deciding on a 
course of action.  One hearing date
 was agreed on for July 2, 2009 with July 17, 2009 as a back-up date.  
On June 11, 2009, the Parent notified 
the Hearing Officer that July 2, 
2009 was not a convenient date for 
a hearing and requested July 9, 2009 instead.  On 
June 12, 2009 the Board&#8482;s a
ttorney requested an 
extension of the mailing date for the 
final decision until 14 days after 
the close of evidence.  The Board&#8482;s 
attorney notified the Hearing Officer on June 15, 2009 
that she was not availabl
e on July 9, 2009 and that 
her client was not available on 
July 17, 2009.  On June 
19, 2009, the Hearing Offi
cer gave the parties 
additional dates in July that she was available. 
 On June 23, 2009, the Board&#8482;s attorney notified the 
Hearing Officer that the parties 
were not all available 
on any of those dates 
and proposed August 13, 
2009 as a hearing date.  The request was granted a
nd the mailing date was extended to September 8, 
2009.  On August 3, 2009, the Parent advised the Hear
ing Officer that the Pa
rties had reached an agreement and that the hearing on August 13, 2009 wa
s not necessary.  On August 5, 2009, the Board&#8482;s 
attorney notified the Hearing Officer that since the 
Parent had withdrawn her request for an independent 
evaluation by Dr. Smaller and had agreed to other 
evaluators suggested by the Board, the Board could 
withdraw the hearing request
.  She requested a dismissa
l without prejudice to re-f
iling in the event that 
there was a problem with completi
on of the agreed-on evaluations.    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  It is ordered that this case shall be dismissed without prejudice.
