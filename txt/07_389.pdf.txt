Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  SUMMARY  This special education hearing was requested via Request for Due Process Hearing 
Regarding Child&#8482;s Placement dated December 27, 2007 and received on January 3, 2008.  The 
30-day resolution period runs through Februa
ry 2, 2008.  The deadline for mailing the final 
decision and order is March 18, 2008. 
 The matter was scheduled for a telephonic pr
e-hearing conference on January 11, 2008.  At that time, Student was represen
ted by her Parent.  Parent sent an email indicating that he was 
retaining an attorney and would not be prepared to proceed with the pre-hearing conference.  The 

email was received too late to cancel the confer
ence in advance.  The undersigned indicated that 
the conference would proceed at which time Parent 
was instructed to relay to his attorney the 
hearing officer&#8482;s order regarding rescheduling the pre-hearing conference.  
Attorney Laubin was instructed to contact Attorney Klebanoff, who 
was identified as Student&#8482;s
 attorney, to discuss rescheduling the pre-hearing conference. 
 Via fax on January 11, 2008, Attorney Klebanoff indicated that he was retained to represent Student.  Attorney Klebanoff requests that the request for he
aring be withdrawn &#64257;in order that we have an opportuni
ty to review the records and 
explore the possibilities of an amicable resolution.&#64258;
