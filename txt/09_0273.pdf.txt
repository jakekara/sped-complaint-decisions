 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  
ISSUES:  1. Did the Salem Board&#8482;s failure to implement the 
Student&#8482;s IEP during the first semester of the 
2008-09 school year result in a denial of FAPE? 
2. What is the appropriate remedy for the Salem Board&#8482;
s denial of FAPE to the Student for the first 
semester of the 2008-09 school year? 
3. Did the Salem Board harass and/or retaliate against the Student for attempting to protect his 
rights under IDEA by further threatening his entitlement to FAPE
 with an unsubstantiated and procedurally flawed residency challenge which resulted
 in a denial of FAPE? 
4. Did the Salem Board&#8482;s failure to provide the 
Student a Board hearing further jeopardize his entitlement to FAPE and result in a denial of FAPE? 
5. If there were such violations, what are the appropriate remedies for these violations? 
6. Did the Board&#8482;s actions substantially contribute to the Student&#8482;s decision to unilaterally remove 
himself from his IEP placement and enroll at 
the Model Secondary School for the Deaf in 
Washington, D.C? 
7. Is the Board responsible for the out of pocket costs associated with the Student&#8482;s enrollment at 
MSSD, such as travel expenses for reasonable visitation to his residence in Connecticut?
