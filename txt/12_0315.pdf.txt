2. Is the Student entitled to an independent educational evaluation at the Board’s expense?

3. Is the Student entitled to receive special education and related services as deﬁned in The
Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA)? If yes;

4. Is the program proposed by the Board for the 201 1—2012 school year appropriate and does it
provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE)? If not;

5. Does the therapeutic day program at Whitney Hall provide the Student with FAPE in the LRE?

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has not been identiﬁed as entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in IDEA 20 U.S.C. §l401 et
seq. and Connecticut General Statute §lO-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting,
the Surrogate Parent rejected the evaluation performed of the Student by the Board. The Surrogate
Parent requested an independent educational evaluation and that the Student be identiﬁed as eligible to
receive special education and related services as deﬁned in IDEA. The Board refused the Surrogate
Parent’s request and ﬁled for due process on Febwary 23, 2012. On FebruaIy 27, 2012, the Surrogate
Parent ﬁled for due process alleging that the Student should be identiﬁed as eligible to receive FAPE; 0n
the same date, the Board received notice of the Surrogate Parent’s request for due process.

The Surrogate Parent’s attorney ﬁled a Motion to Consolidate the two matters. The Board did not object
to the Motion to Consolidate. On March 4, 2012, the matters were consolidated. The consolidation
altered the timeline of the request for due process. The palties agreed to go to mediation in place of a
resolution meeting.
