eligible for special education and related services as defined in 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. The parents requested a due process hearing on January 23, 2004.  A pre-hearing 
conference was scheduled for February 6, 2004 and again on February 13, 2004.  On neither occasion was the contact made with parent&#8482;s attorney.  The Board filed a Motion

the pre-hearing conference.  The parent&#8482;s attorney filed an Objection to the Motion to Dismiss. 
 A hearing date was set for March 26, 2004 to hear arguments on the Motion and to 

proceed with the due process hearing if the Motion was denied.  At the hearing the parties were able to settle the matter and were allowed time to put their agreement in writing.

submitted a letter to the hearing officer advising that agreement had been executed and 
that the matter was to be dismissed with prejudice.
