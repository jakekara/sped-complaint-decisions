FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Was the program provided by the Board from June 11, 2014 to the end of the 2014-2015 school
year appropriate and did it provide the Student with a free and appropriate pub1ic education
(FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE)? If not:

2. Was the program provided by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year appropriate and did it
provide the Student with FAPE in the LRE?

3. Is the Student entitled to Compensatory Education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student is identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals
With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut
General Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents did not
agree with the program offered for the 2015-2016 school year; the Parents requested reimbursement
for the cost of the Student’s attendance at Lighthouse Livecta program in Niantic. The Board denied
the Parents’ request.

On June 11, 2016, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The Student is
twenty—one years old and has executed a power of attorney giving his Parents decision making
authority on educational issues. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on June 13, 2016 and a
pre-hearing conference was scheduled for J une 23, 2016. The parties agreed to forego a resolution
meeting and attend a mediation session. The mediation date was August 8, 2016. In an electronic
transmission, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the matter was resolved in
mediation. The Parents’ attorney withdrew their request for due process with prejudice. The Board did
not object. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is August 25, 2016.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education 01' the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescn'ption of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state 01' federal
court by either party in accordance With the provisions of Section 4—183, Connecticut
