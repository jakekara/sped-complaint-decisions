ISSUES:

1. Was the F unctional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) conducted by the District

SUMMARY AND PRO CEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Emotional Disability and is entitled to receive a free and
appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment as deﬁned in the Individuals

19, 2015 and a pre—hearing conference was held on March 25, 2015 . Hearing dates of April 27
and 28, 2015 were chosen by the palties.

In an electronic transmission, dated April 23, 2015, the Boards’ attorney informed the hearing
ofﬁcer that the matter had been resolved and withdrew the matter with prej udice. The hearing
dates were cancelled. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is May 1, 2015.

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.
