Strong, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  This hearing was requested on March 21, 2002.  This hearing officer was assigned to the case on the same day.  A prehearing conference was held on April 1.  At that time no attorneys had appeared in the case.  Mr. Charles Nappi, Acting Director of Special Education, stated that he had not seen any papers on the case because he had just returned from vacation and that he would ask the attorney for the Board to contact the hearing officer.  The Parent did not answer his telephone on the first call, but on the second call responded that he had retained an attorney who was supposed to request a continuance.  He was advised to have his attorney contact the hearing officer immediately.  The prehearing conference was rescheduled for April 5.  At that time, the father, accompanied by his sister, was representing the student.  The Board&#8482;s attorney and the Parent agreed to three hearing dates.  The hearing was then scheduled for April 24, 26 and May 7.  Later that day, an attorney filed an appearance for the Parent and requested a postponement of the April 24 hearing because she was not available.   The request was granted.  Both parties filed exhibits and lists of witnesses.  At 3:00 p.m. on April 25, the Parent&#8482;s attorney faxed a letter to the hearing officer in which she requested a postponement of the April 26 hearing because the parties had reached an agreement to settle the case.  She did not want to withdraw the case until the agreement was finalized and asked to keep the May 7 hearing date.
