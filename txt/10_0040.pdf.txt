FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
This matter was commenced on behalf of the Student
 by his grandparents (referred to herein as the &#64257;Parents&#64258;) by request for due process dated July 25, 2009 (the &#64257;Request&#64258;), sent to the Connecticut 
Department of Education Bureau of Special Educa
tion Due Process Unit (&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;) and received by the 
District on July 27, 2009. The undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer on July 30, 2009.   This is the second due process proceeding involving the Student that has been presented to this Hearing Officer. In the first due
 process proceeding (CTDOE 07-501), the Student, among other things, 
alleged that the District denied him a free and appropriate public 
education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) and sought: (1) funding for a unilateral placement at
 Hope Academy for the period April 1, 2008 through the end of the 
2007/2008 school year, including transportation costs; (2) reimbursement
 for certain evaluations and services the Parents had obtained during the 2005/2006, 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 school years; (3) an order defining the special education and related services to be provided to the Student during the summer 
of 2008; (4) an order determining the Student&#8482;s pl
acement for the 2008/2009 school year; (5) an award of 
compensatory education for &#64257;unilateral decision to 
deny underlying disabilities and intensive services and loss of more than two years time;&#64258; and (6) an awar
d of &#64257;reasonable attorneys fees.&#64258;  CTDOE 07-501 was dismissed on July 15, 2008 &#64257;with prejudice&#64258; in light of
 and in accordance with 
the report of the parties 
that they had executed an agreement settling CTDOE 07-501.   
The Request in this case states that the Student has attended Hope Academy since April 2008 and 
identifies an IEP team meeting on Ju
ne 12, 2009 as the pertinent IEP team meeting with respect to this due 
process proceeding. By agreement, a telephonic pre-hearing conf
erence (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) convened on August 13, 2009.  Each party participated through counsel, Attorney Belanger for the Student a
nd Attorney Moses for the Board.  Among other things, the parties at the 
PHC reported that they have waived a resolution meeting in favor of 
pursuing a CTDOE-facilitated mediation as a means of resolving their dispute.  The Board advised that it
