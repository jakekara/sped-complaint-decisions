to receive FAPE as defined in the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Improvement
 Act (IDEIA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. The Student has a congenital 
medical illness defined as arthrogr
yposis that caused the Parents&#8482; request from the Board for aqua therapy as a related 
service and additional services. The Board refused the 
Parents&#8482; request and the Parents filed for due process.
