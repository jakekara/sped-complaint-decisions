tricia M. Strong, Hearing Officer FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
ISSUES: 1. Does the Student require a change in bus transportation and an aide
 on the bus in order 
to receive a free appropriate public education? 
2. Is it permissible for the Board to require
 the Student to use the nurse&#8482;s bathroom following a suspension for mi
sconduct on the school bus? PROCEDURAL HISTORY: 
The Parent (Mother) faxed a form to the Stat
e Department of Education (&#64257;SDE&#64258;) on January 
11, 2010 requesting a due process hearing.  The BOE r
eceived a copy of the request on that date. On 
January 15, 2010, the Board&#8482;s attorney filed an appearance with the SDE.  This Hearing Officer was 
assigned to the case on January 20, 2010. On Janua
ry 28, 2010, the SDE advised the Hearing Officer that the parties may have settled the case by way of
 a resolution agreement.  A prehearing conference was held on February 3, 2010.  The Hearing Officer
 was unable to reach either the Parent or the 
Board&#8482;s attorney and left messages with both.  Th
e Parent telephoned later and apologized for missing 
the call and stated that a hearing was not necessary.  She said &#64257;things
 are working out&#64258; and she was not sure what she needed to do. On February 11, 2010, 
the Hearing Officer sent 
a letter to the parties advising that if the Parent did not wish to pursue the case, she needed
 to send a letter to the Hearing 
Officer withdrawing the hearing request.  The case 
would then be dismissed and a decision would be 
mailed to them by the SDE.  The 
Parent did not send a letter or any further communication to the 
Hearing Officer. The mailing date for 
the final decision is March 29, 2010.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: 
It is ordered that this 
case shall be dismissed.
