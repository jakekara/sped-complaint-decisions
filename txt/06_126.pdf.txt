 SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
:  The student is a 19 years old young woman who has been 
identified with emotional 
disturbance requiring special education and related services and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education as defined in Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et se
q. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. The student&#8482;s parents requested that the Board provide the student with compensatory education for the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 school years. The Board rejected the 

Parents&#8482; request. On or about May 19, 2006 the Parents sent the Board a letter advising them that they were requesting a due pr
ocess hearing. On or about May 24, 2006, the Board received notice of the Pa
rents request for due process. On or about May 22, 2006 an impartial special 
education officer was appointed to hear the matter. A pre-hearing conference was he
ld on June 5, 2006 and the parties informed 
the hearing officer that they would be going to mediation and waived a resolution 
meeting. A hearing date of July 12, 2006 was c
hosen by the parties. This hearing date was later cancelled and a new hearing date of July 18, 2006 was chosen by the parties.
