preheating conference addressed the issue of scheduling ot‘expett witnesses, the volume
of exhibits that would be produced and the subsequent need to review those exhibits and
possible objections prior to the start of the hearing, as well as a conceptual framework for
the length of time needed by the Parties for the hearing itself. A subsequent hearing date
of May 7, 2014 was set. On April 25, 2014 counsel for the Board notiﬁed the Hearing
Ofﬁcer that a tentative agreement had been reached in this matter but had not yet been
formalized, The Board, in anticipation of a possible failure to formalize the tentative
agreement, also ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss and Strike, along with a Memorandum of Law
in Support of the Motion to Dismiss and Strike, The Board stated that it expected that a
withdrawal with prejudice would be forthcoming on May 5, 2014 if the agreement was
formalized in writing by that date. It was anticipated that if that were not the case, that
the Motion to Dismiss and Strike would be heard on May 7, 2014 prior to the
commencement of the due process hearing. On May 5, no withdrawal was received by
the Hearing Ofﬁcer. On May 6,2014 at 7:08 PM, the Hearing Ofﬁcer received
notiﬁcation from counsel for the Parent that the agreement had been formalized in
writing and that the Parent would be withdrawing the complaint with prejudice at the due
process hearing on May 7, 2014. The Parent formally withdrew the complaint, with
prejudice, at the start of the due process hearing on May, 7, 2014. The Parties
acknowledged that the pending Motion to Dismiss and Strike would not be ruled on as
the issue was moot at that point.
