SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

 

October 7, 2014 Final Decision and Order Case No. 15-0059

The Student has been identiﬁed as Other Health Impaired and is entitled to receive FAPE as
deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq.
and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq.

At a PPT meeting, the Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2014-2015
school year. The Parents requested placement of the Student at Ben Bronz Academy for the
2014-2015 school year. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On July 24, 2014 the Parents’ ﬁled a request for due process (Hearing Ofﬁcer’s Exhibitsl N0. 2)
on the above captioned matter. A prehearing conference was held on August 14, 2014 and the
matter was discussed and issues were presented. A Pre-Hearing Conference Memo (H.O.3) was
sent to all parties outlining the minutes of the pre—hearing conference. There was neither an
objection to the Pre-Hearing Conference Memo nor a request to clarify the minutes. Hearing
dates of October 2, 6 and 15, 2014 were chosen by the parties. The hearing date of October 2,
2014 was cancelled by the hearing ofﬁcer to accommodate the order on the Motion to Dismiss.

On August 21, 2014 a Motion to consolidate this matter with Case No. 14-0572 (H.O. No. 4)
(before Hearing Ofﬁcer Ann Bird, Esq.), Student v1 Willington Board of Education was ﬁled by
the Student’s attorney. At the request of Hearing Ofﬁcer Ann Bird, The Parents’ attorney
provided the hearing ofﬁcers with copies of the request for due process of both matters. (H.O.
No. 5) The hearing ofﬁcers conferred on the consolidation of the two cases. On August 26, 2014,
Hearing Ofﬁcer Ann Bird, Esq. denied the Motion to Consolidate. (H.O. N0. 6)

Neither Regional District 19 Board of Education nor the hearing ofﬁcer had been made privy to
the fact that there was another matter pending at the August 14, 2014 pre-hearing conference 01'
that a Motion to Consolidate was being contemplated.

Upon receiving a copy of the due process complaint of Case No. 14-0572, Student v. Willington
Board of Education, and comparing it to the due process complaint in this matter, it was noted
that the relief sought in Case No. 14-0572 was the same relief sought in the this matter;
“Whether the Program offered by the Board for the 2014—201 5 school year was appropriate and
did it provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least
restrictive environment (LRE), Does the program at Ben Bronz Academy offer the Student
FAPE in the LRE and Should the Board pay for the placement of the Student at Ben Bronz
Academy for the 2014-2015 school year?”

It was also noted that the local educational agency (LEA) at the time of the creation of the
individualized education program (IEP), that is in contention, was the Willington BOE not
Regional School District 19.

At the request of the hearing ofﬁcer the parties ﬁled briefs on the issue: Why this matter should
not be dismissed? The parties ﬁled simultaneous briefs on September 10, 2014. (H0. Nos. 7
and 8)

The Parents’ attorney in her brief and in the request for due process clearly states that

' Hereafter Hearing Ofﬁcer’s Exhibits will be noted as “PLO.” followed by the number of the exhibit

 

October 7, 2014 F ina1 Decision and Order Case No. 15-0059

Regional School District 19 was not responsible for the Student until July 1, 2014 and that
Regional School District 19 attended the planning and placement team (PPT) meeting of the May
2, 2014 PPT.

The allegations and issues presented in the request for PPT needing due process, Case No. 15-
0059, Student v.

Regional District 19 B013 relate to the May 2, 2014 for which the LEA was Willington BOE.
Section 34 CFR § 300.321(a)(4) "requires the IEP Team to include a representative of the
public agency who is qualiﬁed to provide or supervise the provision of specially designed
instruction to meet the unique needs of children with disabilities; is knowledgeable about the
general education curriculum; and is knowledgeable of LEA resources. A public agency may
determine which speciﬁc staff member will serve as the agency representative in a particular IEP
Team meeting, so long as the individual meets these requirements . It is important, however,

that the agency representative have the authority to commit agency resources and be able to
ensure that whatever services are described in the IEP wili actually be provided.” 71 Federal
Register 46670, The administrator with the authority to commit agency resources at the May 2,
2014 PPT was an employee of the Willington BOE and not Regional District 19. Second Circuit
“snapshot” standard at the time of the allegations, in the request for due process when the May 2,
2014 IEP was created, would p1ace the responsibility of the IEP 0n the Wi11ington Board of
Education.

The responsibility for the Student’s program as stated by the Parents’ attorney was not
transferred to Regional District 19 until July 1, 2014. On July 1, 2014 Regional District 19 was
required to implement the IEP created by the Willington BOB. If a child with a disability (who
had an IEP that was in effect in a previous public agency in the same State) transfers to a new
public agency in the same State, and enrolls in a new school within the same school year, the
new public agency (in consultation with the parents) must provide FAPE t0 the child (including
services comparable to those described in the child's IEP from the previous public agency), until
the new public agency eitheri(1) Adopts the child's IEP from the previous public agency; or (2)
Develops, adopts, and implements a new IEP that meets the applicable requirements in §§
300.320 through 300.324. 34 CFR §300.323(e). The issues raised in this due process complaint
a11 stem from the creation of the May 2, 2014 IEP, and not its implementation which became the
responsibility of Regional District 19 BOE on July 1, 2014.

The Board’s Motion to Dismiss the Student’s due process complaint was granted on September
29, 2014. There was no relief in the request for due process in this matter that this hearing
ofﬁcer could order for the Student.

The mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is October 7, 2014.
