 Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The prehearing in this matter was conducted on March 7, 2006.  Both parties participated 
and hearing dates that were agreed to were selected.  The issues in dispute were a failure to properly evaluate and a failure to provide FAPE for the 2005-2006 school year.  The date for mailing of the final decision was set by agreement at May 28, 2006. The parties 

indicated they were going to pursue mediation and the hearing dates were selected to 

allow time for that to occur.  Prior to the first day of hearing the Student advised that the 

parents were hopeful the matter would be resolved through mediation and were 

withdrawing their due process request to pursue only mediation, and thereby permit 

greater flexibility in scheduling.    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
