  FINAL ORDER AND DECISION  The student is a 3 year-old young boy who has been identified as autistic and is entitled to receive a free appropriate public education as defined in 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;1401 et seq. The Board in compliance with 34 C.F.R. 300.343, in January, February and again on or about 

March 7, 2005, prior to the student attaining the age of 3 years old, conducted a Planning and Placement Team (hereafter &#64257;PPT&#64258;) meeting at which an Individualized Educational 
Program (hereafter &#64257;IEP&#64258;) was developed for the student. The Parents objected to the 

program developed for the student at the PPT and requested a Due Process Hearing on or 
about March 10, 2005. On or about March 11, 2005 the Board also filed a request for Due Process based on their denial of the Parents&#8482; request for independent psychological 

evaluation and an independent evaluation of the preschool program developed for the 
student.  On or about March 14, 2005 an impartial hearing officer was appointed for the due 

process hearing. On or about March 21, 2005 a pre-hearing conference was conducted and hearing dates of April 6, 7, 11 and 12, 2005 were chosen by the parties. At the pre-hearing conference, the Parents insisted on a hearing decision within the 45 day period as provided by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (hereafter &#64257;IDEA&#64258;). At the 
pre-hearing conference the hearing officer was appraised that the student was not 

receiving any educational program because the Parents had rejected the IEP and the 
student was being provided services through the Department of Mental Retardation&#8482;s 
&#64257;Birth to Three Program&#64258; pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes &#167;17a-240. Since the 
parties could not agree to a stay put for the student, the hearing officer provided the
