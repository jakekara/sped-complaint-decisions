 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  ISSUES: 1. Is the student entitled to an independent psychological evaluation at the Board&#8482;s expense? 
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:   The student is a 17 years and 4 months young 
man who had been identified as a student with a disability as defined in Individual
s with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 
U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a and is was entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;).  On or about November 5, 2005 the PPT found that the student no longer qualified for special 
education and related services. The parent did not 
agree with the team&#8482;s decision and requested an 
independent psychological evaluation of the student. This requ
est was granted by the Board. The 
Parent did not have the student evaluated in
 a timely manner and again on June 16, 2006, 
requested an independent psychological evaluation.
 The Board denied the Parent&#8482;s second request 
and the parent filed for a due process hearing.  
On or about July 17, 2006, the Board received no
tice of the due process request and on or about 

July 17, 2006 a hearing officer was appointed to hear the matter. 
A pre-hearing conference was held on August 1, 
2006 and a hearing date of September 20, 2006 
was chosen by the parties. A resolution meeting was held on August 8, 2006. 
In a letter sent to the hearing officer, the Parent 
informed the hearing officer that the matter had 
been resolved by the parties and the request fo
r due process was being withdrawn with prejudice. 
The matter is therefore, withdrawn with prejudice.
 The final decision and order date was ex
tended to accommodate the hearing date. 
The date for the final decision and order is October 20, 2006.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: 
 The due process hearing is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE
