PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This matter was ﬁled on May 14, 2014, on behalf of the Parents. The preheating conference was held
on May 28, 2014, from which it was determined that an Amended Complaint would be ﬁled. The
Parties agreed, due to the short time frame before the new school year, that the timelines would be
adjusted by the number of days between the preheating conference and the ﬁling of the Amended
Complaint and the Response to be ﬁled by the Board. The Amended Complaint was ﬁled on June 6,
2014, with a response by the Board ﬁled on June 19, 2014. The issues listed above were developed
ﬁ‘om the preheating conference and the Amended Complaint. Initial due process hearing dates were set
for July 9 and July 11, 2014. The Parties continued to negotiate for a settlement. On July 2, 2014, with
no opposition from the Parents, the Board requested a postponement of the July 9 and 1 1, 2014 hearing
dates, citing progress in the negotiations and the belief that a settlement could be reached. The due
process hearing was rescheduled to August 1, 2014 and August 4, 2014. On July 16, 2014, Counsel for
the Parents notiﬁed the Hearing Ofﬁcer via email that the Parents wished to withdraw the complaint
without prejudice.
