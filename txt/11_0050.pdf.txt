FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
: The Student is 17 years and 6 months old, has been identified as having Autism and is entitled to receive a free and 

appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. 
&#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. At a PPT 
meeting, the Parents&#8482; did no
t agree with the 2010-2011 school program recommended by the PPT team and requested that the Student be placed in a day treatment program. The 

Board refused the Parents&#8482; request and the Board requested due process. 

On or about July 16, 2010, the Parent received notice of th
e Board&#8482;s request for due process. An impartial hearing officer 
was appointed on July16, 2010 and a pre-hearing conference was held on July 27, 2010. On or about August 3, 2010 the 

Parents filed for due process and another pre hearing c
onference was held on August 16,
 2010. The Board received notice of the Parents request for due process on or about July 27, 2010. 

The parties agreed to consolidate the matters into one due process hearing. The parties agreed to mediation in place of a 

resolution meeting. Mediation was scheduled for September 
3, 2010 but was cancelled by the Parent. Hearing dates of 
September 21, 2010, October 25, 27, 28 and Novemb
er 19 and 22, 2010 were chosen by the parties.
