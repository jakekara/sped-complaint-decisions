FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Did the Norwalk Board of Education (“Board”) offer the Student a free and appropriate public
education for the 2013-2014 academic year (commencing from June 25, 2013)?

2. If not, does the Winston Preparatory School offer the Student a FAPE, and if so, is the Board
responsible to reimburse the Parents?

3. Was the Board procedurally non-compliant, resulting in a denial of a FAPE, through the
improper planning and placement team (“PPT”) notice provided to the Parents?

PRO CEDURAL HISTORY:

The complaint was initially ﬁled on August 19, 2013. The initial ﬁnal decision and order date was set
for November 1, 2013. A preheating conference was held on September 9, 2013, in which the issues
were identiﬁed and initial hearing dates of November 14 and November 15, 2013 were set. The Palties
requested to reschedule the hearing dates to allow for mediation, and to extend the ﬁnal decision and
order date for settlement purposes. The request was granted; the ﬁnal decision and order date was set
for November 25, 2013. Due to an emergency situation with a Board staff member, the hearing dates
were rescheduled to December 11, 2013, with the ﬁnal decision and order date extended to December
24, 2013. The Parties attended mediation and tentatively reached an agreement and requested that the
December 11, 2013 hearing date be rescheduled to allow the Paities to formalize the agreement. The
hearing date was moved to January 10, 2014, with a ﬁnal decision and order date set for January 23,
2014. Counsel for the Board subsequently was required to attend a hearing in Federal Court on January
10, and requested a two week extension of the hearing date. The hearing date was set for January 27,
2014, with a ﬁnal decision and order date set for January 30, 2014. On January 24, 2014, Counsel for
the Parents withdrew the complaint, in writing, stating that the matter had been resolved.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

On Januaiy 24, 2014, Counsel for the Parents withdrew the complaint. With no funher issues to be
decided, this matter is DISMISSED.
