FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUE:

 

Are the services of Dr. Eric Nicholson required in order for the Student to receive
a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment?

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The student has been identiﬁed as Other Health Impaired and is entitled to receive a
free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”) as deﬁned in IDEIA 20 U.S.C. §1401 et
seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10~76a. The Parent objected to the termination of
the services of the treating psychiatrist and asked that his services be reinstated. The
Board refused the Parent’s request.

On or about December 1, 2010, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request
for due process. A resolution meeting was held on December 13, 2010 and the parties
agreed to continue mediating the matter if not resolved at the resolution meeting. An
impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on December 1, 2010 and a pre—hearing
conference was held on December 15, 2010. A hearing date ofJanuary 25, 2011 was
agreed to by the parties.

The Parent, in an electronic transmission, requested that they be allowed to
withdraw the matter without prejudice as they would continue mediating the matter rather
than go forward with a due process hearing. The request was granted. The date for the
mailing of the ﬁnal Order and Decision is February 14, 2011.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED without prejudice.
