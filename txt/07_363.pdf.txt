the third grade and who has not been identified as a student requiring special 
education and related services  as defined in 
the Individuals with Disabilities Educatio
n Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a.  The Studen
t's kindergarten, first-grade, second-grade, 
and third-grade teachers have all observed issues rega
rding the Student's so

terioration of the Student&#8482;s reading abilities.  The Student was referred 
to a planning and placement team (&#64257;PPT&#64258;), wh
ich recommended initial evaluations in the 
areas of academics, intellectual achieveme

order allowing it to perform the recommended 
evaluations of the Student.
