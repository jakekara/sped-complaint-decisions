ISSUES:

1. Was the program offered by the Board for the 201 1-2012 school year appropriate
and does it provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education
(FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE)? If not;

2. Does the program at Ben Bronz Academy provide the Student with FAPE in the
LRE?

3. Should the Board be responsible for the cost of the Student’s placement at Ben
Bronz Academy as of September 1, 201 1?

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as Other Health Impaired (0H1) and is entitled to receive
FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA)
20 U.S.Ct §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statutes (CGS) §10—76a. At a Flaming
and Placement Team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program offered by the
Board and requested placement of the Student at Ben Bronz Academy. The Board refused
the Parents’ request.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to CGS §10-76h and related
regulations, 20 United States Code §1415(t) and related regulations, and in accordance
with the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, CGS §§4-176e to 4-178, inclusive, and
4~181a and 4—186.

 

May 31, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12—0061

The palties were under a settlement agreement through August2011; the claims raised by
the Parents penain to the procedural and substantive violations as they would have
impacted the Student from August 31, 201 1 forward.

On or about August 8, 201 1, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due
process. An impaltial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on August 9, 2011, and a pre-hearing
conference was scheduled for August 25, 2011. The parties agreed to forego a resolution
meeting and go to mediation The parties met in mediation on October 27, 201 l, but did
not reach agreement.

On November 18, 2011, the Board requested that the hearing ofﬁcer order the Parents to
allow the Board to conduct speech and language, occupational therapy, physical therapy
auditory and psychological evaluations of the Student. The Parents’ attorney ﬁled a
timely objection. At the December 14, 201 1 hearing the hearing ofﬁcer granted the
speech and language, occupational therapy, physical therapy and auditory evaluations but
denied the Board’s request for a psychological evaluation,

The hearing convened on December 14, 2011, February 7, 2012, and March 6, 9, 12, and
14, 2012. The December 22, 2011 and January 5, 9, and 11, 2012 hearing dates were
cancelled. The Board submitted Exhibits 11 througth4. Board Exhibit B—73 was
presented as a forty-three page exhibit. It was divided into two exhibits, B-73 pages 1 to
30 and B-73a pages 1 to 13. The Parents submitted Parent Exhibit 1 through Exhibit 26.
Parent Exhibit 24 was not accepted as an exhibit of the hearing.

The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate
the parties’ mediation, hearing dates and Post Trial Briefs. The date for mailing the Final
Decision and Order is May 31, 2012.

This Final Decision and Order sets forth the hearing ofﬁcer’s summary, ﬁndings of fact
and conclusions of law. The ﬁndings of facts and conclusions of law set forth herein,
which reference certain exhibits and witness testimony, are not meant to exclude other
supported evidence in the record. All evidence presented was considered in deciding this
matter. T0 the extent that the summary, procedural history and ﬁndings of fact actually
represent conclusions of law, they should be so considered and vice versa. SAS Institute

eligible to receive special education and related services under IDEA. (Testimony Of
Mother, B-20)

On 01‘ about November 9, 2005, the Student was administered a neuro-psychologieal
evaluation. The evaluator found that it was essential for the Student to continue
receiving speech and language, occupational therapy and physical therapy. He
recommended small group/individual academic instruction to help focus his attention.
The evaluator anticipated that these services would eventually be discontinued. The
Parents provided the private speech and language, occupational therapy and physical
therapy. (B-34)

While attending the 2"d grade at the Board’s school, the Parents obtained a private
auditory processing evaluation of the Student and provided it to the Board. The
evaluation demonstrated that he exhibited central auditoxy processing difﬁculties. The
evaluator made several recommendations, including small groups, Visuals, repeating
and rephrasing as well as a trial of an FM system. This evaluation was not reviewed
at a PPT. (Testimony of Mother, B—41).

. In February 2008, the Student was given an Audiological and Auditory Processing
Assessment. The Student demonstrated auditory processing weaknesses in all the
areas of auditory processing that were evaluated. The signiﬁcant listening weaknesses
impact school performance. The evaluator recommended that the Student continue to
use the FM system at school, be in close proximity to his teacher, have short intense
periods of instmction, have pre-teaching of new vocabulary items and be encouraged
to ask for clariﬁcation when message 01‘ directions are unclear. (P-l)

In March 2008, the Student was administered the Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT).
The results of the test showed that the Student was below basic level in the grade 3
Mathematics test, mastering only one of the twenty ﬁve content strands, Time. He
was below basic level in the Reading test with a Degree of Reading Power (DRP) unit
score of 27, The Student did not master any of the four content strands of the
Reading test: Forming a General Understanding, Developing Intelpretation, Making
Reading/Text Connections and Examining the Content and Structure. On the Writing
test, he also scored below basic level with 6 in writing prompts, and did not master
any of the two content strands of Composing/Revising and Editing. (P—2)

. In March 2009, the Student was given an Audiological and Auditory Processing

Assessment. The Audiological testing showed that the Student would have difﬁculty
listening and processing auditory input. He demonstrated difﬁculty in the areas of
comprehension (auditory/linguistic processing), auditory decoding and auditoty
closure and selective listening. These weaknesses will affect his ability to
comprehend spoken language and follow directions. (Testimony of Dr. J ill Raney,
B—70)

The audiologist recommended that the Student continue the use of an FM system at
school. He should be placed in a quiet environment and in close proximity to the
teacher. (B-70, B—71)

On or about December 17, 2009, the Parents provided the Board with a copy of the
neuro-psychoiogical evaluation of the Student by Dr. Cristina Ciocca. The evaluation
had been conducted from May to August 2009 while the Student still attended the
Board’s school. The evaluator found that the Student thrived in a small classroom and
required that information be broken down. The Student stmggied in co-taught
classrooms and did not participate in class. His processing issues and pragmatic
language deﬁcits interfered with his peer interaction. The Student’s social experience
was impeded by his developmental delays and immaturity. He became easily
frustrated and irritable and resorted to avoidance of uncomfortable tasks. The Student
showed improvement in reading decoding but both oral and silent comprehension was
an area ofconcern. The Student had weaknesses in mental and written calculations,
difﬁculty in relating his topics to the required assignment, and poor story stnlcture.
His writing was below grade level. The Student was diagnosed with ADHD,
Neurological Impairment, and PDD NOS. (Testimony of Dr. Ciocca, B-73)

The doctor made 22 recommendations. Among them were the following:

a. Preferentialseating;

b. Intensive structured language-based program within a small classroom
environment;
A systematic plan to help him remain on track, focused and motivated;
Academic ﬂuency skills in his program to address his processing speed
difﬁculties;
Building frequent academic success to enhance his self—esteem;
Extended time and direct support;
Breaking assignments into smaller parts; and
Continue extensive services in occupational therapy, physical therapy and
speech and language pathology.
(Testimony of Dr. Ciocca, B-73)

The Student entered Ben Bronz Academy (Academy) in the summer of 2009, He was
admitted as a fulltime student on or about September 2009. The Student demonstrated
issues in reading and fmstratation when asked to speak more clearly. (Testimony of
Director of the Academy)

At the September 8, 2009 PPT, the Parents requested placement at the Academy.
This request was rejected. The Parents wanted the Student to be at grade level. The
Parents and the Board mediated an agreement so that the Student could attend the
Academy. The agreement was for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school year. The
Board would pay a lump sum payment for each school year and the Parents would be
responsible for any additional costs. The agreement provides for the Board to
convene a PPT in May 2010 to plan the Student’s 2010-201 1 individualized
education program (IBP). The Parents could accept or reject the IEP developed by the

PPT for the 2010-2011 school year. The Parents rejected the IEP and the Student
continued at the Academy for the 2010-2011 school year. (B-76, Testimony of
Director of Pupil Services (DPS), Testimony of Mother)

Counseling, physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech and language are not
provided as related services at the Academy but are incorporated in the Student’s
program. Counseling was not provided to the Student as the Academy was of the
opinion that it was not necessary. If he needed any speech and language services, he
can either do pull out services, the speech pathologist can give him service in the
class, or use a consultative model where the pathologist tells the Academy what is
needed and the Academy’s teachers provide the service. (Testimony of Director of
the Academy)

On November 3, 2009, the Parents received a psychotherapy report of the Student.
The Student attends a psychotherapy session once a week for 75 minutes. The session
focuses on reading social cues, understanding social perspectives, managing anxiety,
processing situations and developing skills to establish and maintain friendships. The
Student becomes overwhelmed when issues are addressed in large groups. He
becomes more interactive and has greater social success in small group activities. The
Student needs to learn in a small, direct—instruction environment that is both concrete
and nutturing. This report was provided to the Board by the Parents. (B-75,
Testimony of Mother)

The Student’s grade 4 CMT showed that the Student was below basic level in the
grade 4 Mathematics test, mastering only one of the twenty ﬁve content strands,
Pictorial Representation of Numbers. He was below basic level in the Reading test
with a DRP unit score of 48. The Student did not master any of the four content
strands of the Reading test: Forming a General Understanding, Developing
Interpretation, Making Reading/Text Connections and Examining the Content and
Structure. In the Writing test, he also scored below the basic level with 7 in writing
prompts and did not master any of the two content strands of Composing/Revising
and Editing. (B—80, 1398)

The Student’s 2009—2010 progress report of goals and objectives showed that he had
made satisfactory progress in all his goals and he was making unsatisfactoly progress
in 4 objectives of the service plan. A comment in the April 2010 progress repott
stated that the Student had problems with alticulation and comprehending directions.
The Student was not receiving speech and language services. (Testimony of Mother)

The Academy does not offer any electives because there is not enough time for
additional classes. The testing demonstrated that when the Student entered the
Academy, he was reading at level 3. The Student was now reading at a level 10.
Reading is addressed in every class. The Student’s writing classes have not dealt with
handwriting because he uses typing. The Student has many needs but concentrating
on language processing is necessary for executive functioning to improve.
(Testimony of Director of the Academy)

The Student is not at grade level in mathematics. When he ﬁrst entered the Academy
he was dropped to a lower level mathematics class. Any additional assistance in
mathematics needs to be done after school because of his current schedule. The
Student was obsewed to see if noise was a factor in his learning. The Academy staff
decided that background noise was not an issue and an FM system was not necessary.
(Testimony of Director of the Academy)

The Student has not required counseling while at the Academy. He has “melted
down” a few times, and has had tantrums but they were few. If he has social skills
needs they would be given as outside service. The Student has not demonstrated a
need for social services. (Testimony of Director of the Academy)

The Student’s March 201 1 Academy progress repott showed that he had made
satisfactory progress in all his goals and objectives. His 6‘“ grade report card showed
that the Student was doing A and B work. (B—84)

On or about February 201 1, the Parents had D1'. Cristina Ciocca perform a neuro-
psychological evaluation of the Student. Dr. Ciocca noted that he still snuggled with
mathematics. His executive functionng deﬁcits and poor number sense contributed to
his slow progress in mathematics. The Student’s learning was slow and highly
dependent on repetition, cuing, and instruction speciﬁcally structured to facilitate the
learning concept. He was reading at a lower level than the prior evaluation in 2009,
but his reading tests showed improvement. The Student needed immediate, direct
supp01t; othelwise he was not able to progress. Dr. Ciocca 1111ed out any intellectual
disability. His reading accuracy, rate, and ﬂuency showed a 1 ‘/2 t0 2 grade
improvement. (b—86, Testimony of Dr. Ciocca)

Dr. Ciocca made various recommendations. Among the recommendations made are
the following:

a. Allow the Student seat breaks to help him to maintain focus throughout
the day;

b. Continue his reading program, using comprehension of text to circumvent
memory retrieval difﬁculties;

c. Continue the Cyberslate program to increase his ﬂuency especially in
mathematics. The typing in Cyberslate program is an effective tool for
ﬂuency;

d. Continue the use of positive enforcers to build conﬁdence;

6. The Student requires support, direction, and structure to insure continued
growth and progress;

f. Extended School Year (ESY) services to avoid regression during the
summer;

g. Supplemental social skills training;

11. Additional support and tutoring in mathematics;

i. Extracurricular activities and social programs outside of school to enhance
socialization and social skills practice;

The Student’s progress repoﬂ for the 2010—2011 school year at the Academy showed
that he had mastered Goal 2, mastered Goal 3 but in four objective his progress was
not to criterion. He had mastered Goal 4 but one objective was rated as not to
criterion, Goal 5 was mastered but in 2 of its ﬁve objectives his progress was not to
criterion and Goal 6 was mastered. In Goals 1 and 7, the Student’s progress was not
to criterion. (B—97)

The annual testing summary showed that in the Woodcock Johnson 111 Test of
Achievement, the Student, in his Pictorial Vocabulary in 8/2009, was at a 3.6 grade
equivalent and in 4/201 1 was at a 4.9 grade equivalent; in Oral Comprehension in
8/2009 he was at a 2.8 grade equivalent and in 4/201 1 a 2.5 grade equivalent. In
Broad Math, the Student in 4/2010 was at a 3.8 grade equivalent in the calculations
subset and a 3.6 grade equivalent in 4/201 1; in the math ﬂuency subset in 4/2010, he
was at a 3.6 grade equivalent and in 4/201 1 he was at a 5.3 grade equivalent. In the
Applied Problems subset, in 4/2010 the Student attained a 2.5 grade equivalent and in
4/2011 he was at a 2.6 grade equivalent. (B-87)

On or about May 31, 2011, the Parents informed the Board that the Student was not
receiving any occupational therapy services. (B-88)

On or about June 3, 2011 the Board held a PPT to plan the Student’s 2011-2012
school year. The current assessments utilized were the same as used to plan the 2010—
2011 IEP. The staff from the Academy was not invited to the PPT nor did anyone
from the Board observe the Student in order to plan for the PPT. The Board needed
updated assessments on related services to plan the IEP. (B-89, Testimony of
Mother, Testimony of DPS)

In order to address his reading ﬂuency, the Student’s 2011-2012 IEP called for the
Student to utilize Cyberslate with the Wilson Reading Program. The Cyberslate
program is an Academy program and is offered at the Board School. The Student had
beneﬁted from Cyberslate and although his ﬂuency skills were above grade level this
should not be interpreted to mean that the Student was reading at a 9"l grade level.
The Director of the Academy consulted with the Board regarding its implementation
of the Cyberslate program which was the same program that the Student was being
provided at the Academy. (Testimony of DPS, Testimony of Director of the
Academy).

As a new student, the Student would be assigned a peer who would shadow him to
acquaint him with the school. Both regular and special education students could take
small classes known as lab classes. These classes were scheduled for an entire period
and therefore students were not pulled out from other classes to attend them. Students
are grouped in lab classes by their ability. The Student would be attending small
classes for the majority of the day with students functioning at his academic level.
The lab classes proposed for him were scheduled to have between 2 to 4 students. He
was to be provided with Cyberslate, reading, writing, math and organizational skills

instruction in these small lab classes. He would receive speech and language,
occupational therapy and physical therapy as pull out services in these lab classes; so
he would not miss any core course. (B-89, Testimony of DPS)

The Student also was scheduled to take either science or social studies in the
mainstream with assistance from a paraprofessionals He also was scheduled for a co—
taught language alts class with adult assistance from a paraprofessional. He had an
advisory period one time per week to address social skills, adjustment to school and
related issues. (B-89, Testimony of DPS)

The Student also had two Quest classes per week where he could select an area of
interest each quarter. The Quest classes are regular education classes that are
designed to foster social skills development and teach problem solving skills. These
classes would be with non-disabled peers and are not for credit, so there would be no
pressure for grades. (B-89, Testimony of DPS)

The Student would sit with a behavior specialist and the school psychologist to
evaluate his needs. Incentives would be concrete so that he could understand them.
Data that is collected would be reviewed every two weeks to allow for any
modifications to his program. (B-89, Testimony ol‘DPS)

The Academy staff was not invited to attend the June 3, 2011 PPT. The DPS
consulted with the Academy prior to the PPT about the Student. The Academy staff
informed the DPS that the Student was making slow progress and his test scores were
inconsistent with his progress. If the Student needed more assistance with
mathematics, the PPT would ﬁnd time to address his need. The Student is motivated
by academic success. (B—89, Testimony of DPS)

On or about November 2011 the Parents referred the Student to Bayside Children’s
Hospital for a speech and language evaluation. The Student was administered the
Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4m Edition. He presented with
moderate—severe receptive and expressive language delays characterized by poor
memory, language skills, and language processing skills. His skills were equivalent to
a 5-6 year old. He did not score average in any subset. His mem01y and recall were
below average for his age range and treatment was recommended. (P—26)

Bayside Children’s Hospital also administered an occupational therapy evaluation.
The student demonstrated severe delays in ﬁne motor functions. It was recommended
that the student receive sewices for fine motor development. (B-16)

Bayside Children’s Hospital also performed a physica1 therapy evaluation. The
Student demonstrated low muscle tone strength. The father informed the evaluator
that the Student was in a karate Class. The evaluator was of the opinion that the karate
class would be sufﬁcient and the Student would not require physical therapy services
at this time. (P-16)

In January 2012, the Board performed speech and language, occupational therapy,
physical therapy and audiological evaluations of the Student. The Student had not
received these related services since he left the Board’s school in 2009. These
evaluations were administered as a result of a motion granted by the hearing ofﬁcer.
(11—3, B—89)

On or about January 2012, the Student was administered a speech and language
evaluation. The evaluator found that the Student’s auditOIy and oral communication
skills were in the moderately low range of ability. I-Iis receptive and expressive
language vocabulary was in the moderately low range. Articulation, hearing and oral
motor functioning were within normal range. The evaluation indicated a speech and
language disability. The speech and language pathologist recommended pull out
services for 45 minutes 2 times per week and 75 minutes per week of speech and
language assistance in the Science class. The Student did not seem apprehensive
about returning to the Board’s school; he was concerned about doing well. Based on
the assessments, the Student showed regression in his speech and language and
requires services. (Testimony of Speech and Language Pathologist, B-100)

The Audiologist made an observation of the Student at the Academy. The Student had
better listening behaviors in a 1 to 1 quiet environment. The Student was observed in
the largest classroom with the most people and he appeared to do well in this setting.
In the questionnaire ﬁlled out by his teacher a score of 50 would indicate that the
student “usually” exhibits the listening behavior in a situation. The Student received a
score of 42. The audiologist recommended a trial period of 4 weeks with an FM
system and pre- and post-questionnaires as a way of determining its potential beneﬁt.
(Testimony of Dr. Jill Raney, B-101)

In January 2012, the Board performed an occupational therapy evaluation of the
Student. He had made progress with his ﬁne motor skills using correct finger
placement when typing. He also maintained an average score with his manual
dexterity skills. When performing ﬁne motor precision tasks, he demonstrated
decreased hand strength and endurance. The Student scored below average on the ﬁne
motor integration. It was recommended that he participate in direct occupational
therapy sewices once a month and consultative services 3 times a month. It was
recommended that he participate in a home program to increase his strength and
endurance. (B-102

In January 2012, the Board performed a physical therapy evaluation of the Student
The Student showed improvement in running skills from his prior evaluation. He
showed average performance in balancing and agility. The student showed below
average in coordination activities and strength. Physical therapy was recommended
for 30 minutes each week. (8—103)

 

May 31, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12—0061

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:

1.

The Student qualiﬁes for, and is entitled to receive FAPE with special education
and related services under the provisions of state and federal laws. CGS §10—76, et
seq. and IDEA 20 U.S.C. §1401, et seq.

The Board has the burden of proving the appropriateness of the child’s program or
placement, which burden must be met by a preponderance of the evidence. Conn,
Reg. §10—76h—14(a);P. ex rel. M): P. v. Newington Ba'. 0fEduc., 512 F.Supp.2d 89,
99 (D.Gonn. 2007).

A parent or a public agency may ﬁle a due process complaint on any of the matters
described in 34 CPR. §300.503(a)(1) and (2) (relating to the identiﬁcation,
evaluation 01' educational placement of a child with a disability, or the provision of
FAPE to the child). The due process complaint must allege a violation that occurred
not more than two years before the date the parent or public agency knew or should
have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the due process
complaint, or, if the State has an explicit time limitation for ﬁling a due process
complaint under this part, in the time allowed by that State law, except that the
exceptions to the timeline described in §300.511(f) apply to the timeline in this
section. 34 C.F.R. §300.507.

IDEA opens the door of public education to children with disabilities. Board of
Educ. offhe Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 US. 176, 192 (1982).
Under IDEA, a local education agency (LEA), such as the Board, must provide to
each qualifying student a FAPE in the LRE, including special education and related
sewices. 20 U.S.C. §1401(18).

Under the Supreme Court test established by Rowley, FAPE consists of educational
instruction speciﬁcally designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child,
and related services as are necessary to permit the child to beneﬁt from the
instruction. FAPE is not required to maximize the potential of each child; however,
it must be sufﬁcient to confer educational beneﬁt. 1d. at 200. The Rowley standard
is satisﬁed by providing meaningful access to educational oppottunities for the
disabled child. Id. at 192. The Rowley coutt determined that the IDEA requires
school districts to provide a "basic ﬂoor of opportunity“ consisting of "access to
specialized instruction and related services which are individuaily designed to
provide educational beneﬁt to the handicapped child." Id. at 201. The Supreme
Coult found Congress’ intent in passing the IDEA was ”more to open the door of
public education to handicapped children on appropriate terms than to guarantee
any particular level of education once inside." Id. at 192.

However, the Rowley requirement of consideration of the unique needs of the

handicapped child does require consideration of the child's capacity to learn. Nein v.
Greater Clark County School Corporation, 95 F.Supp.2d 961, 973 (SD. Ind. 2000).
The requirement of ”some educational benefit" requires more than a ”trivial" benefit

but not a maximization of the potential of a handicapped child. NJ. v. Northwest R—
1 School District, 2005 US. Dist. LEXIS 24673, 22 (ED. Mo. 2005).

Under Rowley, there are two components to the FAPE analysis, one procedural and
the other substantive. An educational program can be set aside for failure to provide
FAPE on procedural grounds under three circumstances: (1) where the procedural
inadequacies have "compromised the pupil's right to an appropriate education"; (2)
when the district's conduct has "seriously hampered the parents' opportunity to
palticipate in the formulation process"; or (3) when the procedural failure has
resulted in ”a deprivation of educational benefits." Independent School District No.
283 v. SD, 88 F.3d at 556. Where this type of harm is found, the substantive
question of whether the IEP provided FAPE is not addressed by the hearing panel.
WB. v. Target Range SchoolDisrrict, 960 F.2d 1479, 1485 (9th Cir. 1991).
Assuming no denial of FAPE on procedural grounds, the analysis turns to the
substance of whether the IEP provides FAPE as deﬁned by the Rowlcy standard and
"whether a proposed IEP is adequate and appropriate for a particular child at a
given point in time." Rowley, 458 U.S. at 200; Town ofBurlington v. Dept. of
Education, 736 F.2d 773, 788 (lst Cir. 1984), aff’d 471 US. 359 (1985).

In this matter, the Parents attended all PPTs and in the IEP in question, for the
2011—2012 school year, the Parents were represented by counsel. A11 notice
requirements were clearly adhered to. The Parents did not allege or present
evidence that they were not properly and timely provided with any requests for the
Student’s educational records. There were no procedural violations in this matter.

The 2nd prong 0f Rowley addresses the substantive question of whether the IEP
provided FAPE. In order to decide the appropriateness of the IEP one must View it
as, “a snapshot, not a retrospective. 1n striving for "appropriateness," an IEP must
take into account what was, and was not, objectively reasonable when the snapshot
was taken, that is, at the time the IEP was promulgated. ” D.F. and DR, on behalf
0fN.F., v. Ramapo Central School District, 403 F3d. 595 (2nd. Circuit 2005)

There is no one standard for determining what constitutes a, meaningﬁil,
educational beneﬁt. The Student’s capabilities, intellectual progress and what the
LEA has offered must be considered along with grade promotions and test scores in
determining whether the program offered is reasonably calculated to confer a
nontrivial 0r meaningful educational beneﬁt to the child. See, e.g. Hall, 774 F.2d at
635. Objective factors such as passing marks and advancement from grade to grade
can be indicators of meaningful educational beneﬁts but are not in and of
themselves dispositive. See, e.g., Mrs. B. v. Milford Bd 0fEduc., 103 F.3d 1120
(2nd Cir. 1997).

The program offered the Student, at the June 3, 201 1 PPT, for the 201 1-2012 school
year was not appropriate. “Meaningful educational beneﬁt” requires that the Board
be able to provide for the Student’s unique educational needs. The PPT recognized
its lack of timely and adequate information from the Academy and requested re—

evaluations in order to provide the Student FAPE. (Findings of Fact # 25) This
request was not granted. (H-3) The Pai'ents’ lack of cooperation in obtaining the
evaluations did not motivate the Board to ﬁle for due process in order to provide the
Student with FAPE. IDEA has a provision that would allow the Board to ﬁle for
due process. “If the parent refuses to consent to the reevaluation, the public agency
may, but is not required to, pursue the reevaluation by using the consent override
procedures described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.” (34 C.F.R.
§300.300(c)(ii)) Instead they utilized the same data available in 2009 to complete
his Present Level of Academic Achievement and Functional Performance which is,
the “blueprint” for developing the Student’s IEP and creating his goals and
objectives. The Student had not attended the Board’s school for two years and
during that time the Board had not visited the Student’s placement to see how he
was performing in the classroom. (Findings of Fact No. 25) The Student had not
received related services (speech and language, occupational therapy and physical
therapy) since he left the Board’s school in 2009. (F indings of Fact No. 35) Yet,
goals and objectives were written to address these needs without adequate
knowledge to determine if they were required or the level of service the Student
needs. Neither the academic or related services of the June 3, 201 1 IEP were written
with adequate information to provide for the Student’s unique educational needs.
Extended school year (ESY) should have been offered to assist the Student in his
transition from the Academy, avoid any possible regression and obsewe the Student
to ensure his needs would be met during the 2011—2012 school year. It is clear that
the Student would not make “meaningful” progress with this IEP.

The patties entered into an agreement to place the Student in a program outside of
the Board’s schools. (Findings of Fact No. 1 1) Since the placement of the Student at
the Academy for the 2009—2010 and 2010-2011 school years was by a mediated
agreement, there is no inquhy by this hearing ofﬁcer into the issue whether the
Student received FAPE during the 2009—2010 and 2010-201 1 school years.

The Parents unilaterally continued the placement of the Student at the Academy for
the 201 1-2012 school year. That the patties had agreed to the placement, does not
make the agreed upon placement and program appropriate. The private program
must be specially designed to meet the unique needs of a disabled child and it must
include the services necessary for the child to beneﬁt from instruction. Frank G. V.
Ba’. OfEduc. Onyde Park, 459 F.3d 356, 364-65 (2d Cirt 2006). The placement
need not furnish every special service necessary to maximize the child’s potential.
Id. In this matter the Student was not receiving any of the related services he
required. (Findings of Fact # 35) The Parents’ psychologist recommended that the
Student receive speech and language, occupational therapy and physical therapy.
(Findings of Fact No. 7) The Parents’ psychologist, recognizing the Student’s
deﬁciency in mathematics recommended support and tutoring in mathematics.
(Findings of Fact No. 22) In order to meet the Student’s social skills needs, he had
recommended supplemental social skills training. Neither of these
recommendations could be addressed in the Academy, but were to be provided by
outside services. (Findings of Fact Nos. 17 and 18). The Academy’s focus on

language processing (F indings of Fact No.16) is commendable but “meaningful
educational beneﬁt” includes mathematics as well as related services. Focusing on
one area of academics does not provide the Student with FAPEi The Student
expresses his desire to be successful and in order to succeed; he needs a well
rounded educational program that focuses on all areas of his educational needs. The
program at the Academy is not appropriate and does not provide the Student with
the special education and related services the Student requires.

On February 22, 2012, the parties attended a PPT to review the evaluations ordered
during the hearing. (F indings of Fact N0. 35) This due process hearing does not
address the appropriateness of the IEP developed at that PPT.

The IEP that is the subject of this hearing was created on June 3, 201 1 and the
patties did not request to amend the hearing to include the appropriateness of the
February 22, 2012 IEP. “An IEP is a snapshot, not a retrospective,” and “must take
into account what was objectively reasonable at the time the IEP was drafted.”

denied, 110 LRP 66026, 499 US. 912 (1991).

To the extent that a procedural claim raised by the Parents is not speciﬁcally
addressed herein, the Hearing Officer has concluded that the claim lacked merit.
