December 3, 2015 Final Decision and Order 16-0131

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has not been identiﬁed as entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General
Statutes §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents requested that the
Student be found eligible for special education and related services as identiﬁed in IDEA. The Parents
requested reimbursement for their unilateral placements. The Board refused the Parents’ request. On
September 8, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The parties agreed
to forgo a resolution meeting and mediate the matter.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on September 8, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was held
on September 11, 2015. In an electronic transmission the parties advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the
matter had been resolved and requested cancelation of the hearing date. The panties requested additional
time to ﬁnalize an agreement. The November 20, 2015 hearing date was cancelled.

In an electronic transmission dated December 2, 2015, the parties advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the
agreement had been signed by all parties. The Parents’ attorney withdrew the matter with prejudice. The
mailing date for the F inal Decision and Order is December 18, 2015.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
