 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 
ISSUES: 
 The following issue for the hearing was subm
itted by the Norwalk Board of Education: 
 
1. Did the Board offer the Student a free a
ppropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) in 
the least restrictive environment (&#64257;LRE&#64258;) for the 2007-
2008 school year with a proposed placement at High Road School in Norwalk at the August 29, 2007 Planning and Placement 

Team (&#64257;PPT&#64258;) meeting? 
 SUMMARY: 
 The Student is a 16 year-old student who is not currently attending school.  The Student, also referred to as J., is a young man with serious emotional 
disturbance who had attended the 
Academy of Information Technology and Engin
eering (&#64257;AITE&#64258;) in the 2006-2007 school year.  
The AITE program is a public magnet school 
program in Stamford with an exceedingly 
challenging curriculum for students who are focusi
ng on engineering and technology in a college preparatory program.  The Student was accepted at
 AITE in a lottery.  The Student had numerous 

behavioral incidents at AITE, culminating in 
a manifestation determination by the PPT on March 
22, 2007 that his behavior was not a manifestati
on of his disability.  The Student&#8482;s Mother 
disagreed with the PPT decision and filed for an expedited due process hearing on April 2, 2007.  
The Student remained at AITE pending the outcome of that hearing.  On May 31, 2007 Hearing 

Officer Mary Gelfman issued two orders in that case, first for a psychiatric evaluation of the 

Student overriding the Mother&#8482;s refusal of consent and, second, for an interim placement in 
home bound instruction.  A PPT meeting wa
s convened on August 29, 2007 to review the psychiatric evaluation and develop an IEP for the 2007-2008 school year.  The PPT 
recommended placement of J. at High Road School, a private therapeutic day program located in 

Norwalk, Connecticut.  The Parent (Mother) refused this placement and therefore the Board 
commenced this hearing pursuant to the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat
s., Section 10-76h(a)(2)
