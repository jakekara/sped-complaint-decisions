The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals
With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General
Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the
program offered by the Board for the 2013-2014 school year. The Parents requested placement at The
Speech Academy, in Easton, CT, for the 2013—2014 school year. The Board refused the Parents’ request.
On August 15, 2013, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The parties agreed
to forego a resolution meeting and mediate the matter. The mediation date was October 8, 2013. An
impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on August 20, 2013 and a pi'e—hearing conference was held on
August 28, 2013. A hearing date of October 22, 2013 was chosen by the parties.

In an electronic transmission, the patties requested a postponement of the hearing date. A hearing date of
November 19, 2013 was chosen. At the November 19, 2013 hearing, the palties informed the hearing
ofﬁcer that the matter had been resolved and requested withdrawal. There was no objection by the Board.
The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order was extended in order to accommodate the mediation
and hearing date. The mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is November 28, 2013.
