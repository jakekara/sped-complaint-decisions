FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Whether the Board failed to identify the Student as eligible for special education and
provide the Student with FAPE;
2. Whether the Student shall be placed at the Forman School for the 2013~14 school year at

Board expense.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION: , V

This request for hearing was received by the Board on April 25, 2013 and a preheating
conference convened on May 2, 2013. While the Parent was able to participate with the Board’s
attorney at the preheating conference, near the conclusion of the preheating conference, her
phone lost its charge and the preheating conference concluded. A second preheating conference
was scheduled for May 3, 2013. Prior to the second preheating conference, the Parent submitted
notiﬁcation that she requested that her request for due process be withdrawn without prejudice.
Therefore, this matter is dismissed.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED.
