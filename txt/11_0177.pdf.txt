PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This hearing was requested by Parents on October 25, 2010. The Hearing Ofﬁcer was
appointed on October 29, 2010. The date for mailing the decision was January 8, 2011.

A pre—hearing conference was held on November 15, 2010. At that time, the Parties
reported that they had agreed to waive the resolution meeting and request mediation from
the State Depa1trnent of Education. The Panties requested an extension of the mailing
date for the decision to accommodate settlement negotiations. The Hearing Ofﬁcer
granted that request and pursuant to Section 10-76h—9, Regulations of Connecticut State
Agencies (R.C.S.A.) extended the mailing date from Januaty 8 to Febwary 7, 201 l.
Mediation was scheduled for December 1, 2010.

The hearing was scheduled for January 10 and 13, 201 1. On December 2, 2010, the
Paities reported that mediation had been unsuccessful and requested that additional
hearing dates be scheduled. On December 21, 2010, the Hearing Ofﬁcer scheduled two
additional hearing dates, Februaiy 9 and 10, 2011, and to accommodate these additional
hearing dates extended the mailing date for the decision from February 7 to March 9,
201 1.

On December 23, 2010, Parents ﬁled a Motion Requesting Telephonic Testimony. The

_ Board ﬁled an objection to this motion on December 29, 2010 received by the Hearing
Ofﬁcer on December 30, 2010. The Hearing Ofﬁcer responded to the Motion concerning

telephonic testimony on January 4, 201 1, allowing such testimony with ﬁve conditions.

On December 30, 2010, the Board ﬁled a Motion to Observe the Student in his current
placement. On January 5, 2011, Parents reported that they were “ﬁnalizing a settlement
agreement” and requested that the ﬁrst two hearing dates, January 10 and 13, 2011, be
postponed and that an extension of the deadline of January 6, 2011, for their response to
the Motion to Obsewe, be granted. The Hearing Ofﬁcer granted this request on January
6, 2011 postponing the ﬁrst two hearing sessions and extending the deadline for response
to January 13, 2011. On January 10, 2011 Parents requested a second extension of the
deadline for responding to the Board‘s Motion to Observe, from January 13, 201 1 to
January 27, 2011. On January 12, 2011, the Hearing Ofﬁcer responded with a discussion
of scheduling issues and extended the date to January 27, 201 1. Having received no
response from Parents to the Motion to Observe, the Hearing Ofﬁcer granted that motion
on January 30, 2011.

March 7, 201 1 -3- Final Decision and Order 11-0177

On January 29, 2011, the Hearing Ofﬁcer emailed the Parties concerning the scheduled
convening of the hearing on February 9, 201 1. On February 6, 201 l, the Hearing Officer
sent another email to the Parties, conﬁrming that the hearing would convene on February
9, 201 1. She quoted both Section 10—76h-9 (a), R.C.S.A. and a statement in her
memorandum summarizing the November 15, 2010 pre-hearing conference, reminding
the Parties that a case could be dismissed for failure to communicate with the Hearing
Ofﬁcer.

The Parents responded on February 6, 201 1, citing difﬁculties in ﬁnalizing the settlement
agreement, “multiple snow days” [closing schools] and a death in the Parents’ family for
the delay. The Hearing Ofﬁcer was asked if she “would accept” a withdrawal of the
hearing request if the settlement agreement was ﬁnalized “this week”. On February 7,
201 1, Parents reported that although there was agreement on the basic tenns of the
settlement, “there are still outstanding issues”. A further comment was: “At this point the
withdrawal would be without prejudice”. The Hearing Ofﬁcer cancelled the hearing
sessions scheduled for February 9 and 10, 201 l and awaited further communication.

All motions and objections not previously ruled upon, if any, are hereby overruled.

SUMMARY:

The Student enrolled in the Board’s school on June 4, 2009, was evaluated for special
education and in October 2009, was found eligible for special education as having a
speciﬁc learning disability. Difﬁculties in school continued and Parents enrolled him in
the summer program at the Ben Bronz Academy in 2010. After a difﬁcult start at public
school in the fall of 2010, Parents enrolled Student at the Ben Bronz Academy and
requested a special education hearing.

In order to comply with the confidentiality requirements of the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g and related regulations at 34 C.F.R. §
99, the following decision uses “Student”, “School”, “Parent”, and titles of school staff
members and other witnesses in place of names and other personally identiﬁable
information.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

Having received no further communication from the Parties concerning settlement or
convening the hearing, this matter is DISMISSED without prejudice, pursuant to Section
10-7611-9 (e).
