FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUE:

Shall the Pai'ents’ refusal to consent to various evaluations for the Student be ovemlled?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This hearing was requested by the Board on April 12, 2012. A Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on the
same day. The date for mailing the decision was June 26, 2012.

The Board included in its request a request that this case be consolidated with an ongoing case involving
the same Student. The Hearing Ofﬁcer who had been randomly assigned to this case and the Hearing
Ofﬁcer assigned to the on-going case consulted and agreed to consolidation, with this case to be heard
before the Hearing Ofﬁcer assigned to the previous case. The Hearing Ofﬁcer assigned to this case
withdrew on April 23, 2012, and the prior Hearing Ofﬁcer consolidated the two cases.

Immediately prior to a hearing session on the prior case on April 26, 2012, the Palties notiﬁed the
Hearing Ofﬁcer that consent was being provided, and that when the appropriate signed forms had been
returned, the Board would withdraw the request for a hearing. Therefore, no pre-hearing conference was
scheduled.

By letter dated May 4, 2012, the Board acknowledged that the consents had been received and withdrew
the request for a hearing.

All motions and objections not previously ruled upon, if any, are hereby overruled.
