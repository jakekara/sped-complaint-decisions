    Hearing Officer 
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   The Parent commenced this proceeding on behalf of his son (the Student) by letter 

dated May 6, 2005.  That letter stated that at a PPT on March 21, 2005, the District had denied the Parent&#8482;s request that the District support an out-of-district placement for the 
Student.  A telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) was convened on May 31, 2005 
at which each party participated through their respective counsel. Counsel reported that they have previously discussed resolving their dispute through mediation and affirmed 
their desire to pursue a mediation.   At the request of and by agreement of counsel for the 
parties, the date for issuance of the Final Decision and Order was extended from June 24, 
2005 to and including July 25, 2005 pursuant to Reg. Conn. State Agencies Sec. 10-76h-9(e) to permit the parties an opportunity to pursue a mediation.   
  By letter dated June 16, 2005, the Board requested that the Department-sponsored 
mediation that had been scheduled for June 22, 2005 be cancelled.  The Board claimed 
that the Student is now living with the Parent in another town and that the school district in that town had convened a PPT for the Student on June 15, 2005 and established an IEP for the Student for the 2005/2006 school year.  Although the Board advised that it would seek dismissal of this matter, no motion to dismiss was filed.  The parties through their 

counsel participated in a second PHC convened on June 23, 2005.  At that PHC, counsel for the Parent acknowledged that the June 15, 2005 PPT had mooted claims against the 
Board in this hearing regarding the 2005/2006 school year, but advised that the Student was also asserting claims against the Board regarding the 2004/2005 school year.   
 Counsel for the parties discussed the possibility of trying to resolve those issues through settlement.  Notwithstanding that disc
ussion, a procedural schedule for hearing was established should settlement efforts fail.  The following issues were set for hearing:
