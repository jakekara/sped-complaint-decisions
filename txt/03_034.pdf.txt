March 19, 2003 -1- Final Decision and Order 03-034  STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION   Student v. New Britain Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parents:   Attorney Gary J. C. Woodfield             41 Lexington Street New Britain, CT 06052  Appearing on behalf of the Board:   Dr. Jon Walek  Director Pupil Personnel Services  New Britain Board of Education  272 Main Street  New Britain, CT 06050   Appearing before:     Attorney Patricia M. Strong  Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   PROCEDURAL HISTORY:   This hearing was requested on February 3, 2003.  Another hearing officer was assigned to the case, but after he recused himself, this hearing officer was assigned on February 5. The issues in this expedited hearing involve the Parent's challenge to the manifestation determination by the Board.  On February 7 the Board's representative wrote to the hearing officer advising that the Director of Pupil Services had withdrawn the Board's request for an expulsion of the student at the February 4 hearing before the Board's Expulsion Committee.  He asserted that this action resolved the need for a hearing challenging the previous manifestation determination made the New Britain High School team.  A prehearing conference was held on February 10.  The issue of mootness was discussed and the Parent's attorney agreed that if he verified the information, the case would be withdrawn.  If there was a need for a hearing, he would notify the hearing officer.  As of this date, there has been no withdrawal filed or any communication from the Parent's attorney regarding the need for a hearing.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:  1. It appears that the case is moot based on the actions taken at the February 4 Expulsion Committee meeting revoking the high school administration's request for an expulsion of the student.  If there is no issue in dispute, the case is moot and there is no jurisdiction to proceed further.  &#64257;[M]ootness is evaluated throughout the pendency of the litigation.&#64258;  Fetto v. Conn.
