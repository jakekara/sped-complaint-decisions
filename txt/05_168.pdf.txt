  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  The Student is a 17 years and 6 month young woman who has been identified with 
Intellectual Disability and is entitled to receive a free appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. 
&#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a.  At an IEP meeting on or about 
May 23, 2005, the Parent rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2005-2006 

school year and requested that the Student&#8482;s out of district placement be continued. The 
Board refused the Parent&#8482;s request. On or about June 20, 2005, the Parent requested a Due Process Hearing.  On June 22, 2005, a Hearing Officer was appointed.  A pre-hearing conference was held on June 29, 2005 and agreed upon hearing dates of August 5 and 10, 2005 were scheduled by the parties. In a facsimile transmission dated July 15, 2005, the Parent through her attorney requested 
that the due process hearing be withdrawn without prejudice.  The date for the Final Decision and Order is August 5, 2005. FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
