PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:

The Board received this request for hearing on September 24, 2013 and a preheating conference
convened on September 30, 2013. At the prehearing conference the patties stated that they
agreed to mediation, although mediation had not yet been scheduled. The parties agreed to a
November 21, 2013 hearing date at the preheating conference.

After the mediation concluded, the patties requested that additional hearing dates be scheduled
and requested an extension of the mailing date to allow for the scheduling ofthe additional
December 2, 2013 hearing. Prior to the November 21 hearing date, the Parents’ attorney
requested that the hearing be postponed as the parties were ﬁnalizing a settlement agreement,
which was granted. On November 27, 2013, the Parents’ attorney submitted notification that the
parties had ﬁnalized the agreement and that the Parents withdraw their due process request with
prejudice. Therefore, this matter is dismissed.
