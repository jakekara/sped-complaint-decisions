FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
A special education hearing in the above-captioned matter was requested by the Student via 
Request for Impartial Special Education Hearing da
ted July 9, 2009. It was received by the State Department of Education on July 14, 2009. Absent cont
rary information, it is assumed that the Stamford 
Board of Education received it on the same date. 
Therefore, the 30-day resolution period ran through August 12, 2009. The original deadline for mailing the final decision and order was September 27, 2009. 
A pre-hearing conference was scheduled for July 31, 2009 at 8:30 a.m. Notice was given to the 
Student via US Mail and to the Board of Education via e-mail. Neither party participated in the pre-
hearing conference. The following issue was identified from the request 
for hearing: Should the Board of Education reimburse the Parent for 
the cost of the residential compone
nt of Student&#8482;s placement in a 
residential educational program? The hearing was 
scheduled to convene on August 25, 2009 and August 31, 2009. Via letter dated August 6, 2009, the Board indicated that they believed that this matter had been 
withdrawn in conjunction with the withdrawal of a 
parallel complaint to the St
ate Board of Education on the same issues. The Board represented that the partie
s were working together to finalize a placement that 
is agreeable to both the Student and Board. The Board represented that it needed two additional weeks to 

complete the necessary arrangements and secure an 
appropriate placement. The Board requested that the 
hearing be postponed for thirty days to allow the parties to complete the agreed upon arrangements. The 
request was denied for failure to comply with 
Connecticut State Regulations Section 10-76h-9. The 
parties were permitted to file a new reque
st in compliance with the regulations.
