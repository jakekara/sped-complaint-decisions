FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Is the program provided by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year appropriate and does it
provide the Student with FAPE in the LRE? If not;

2. Should the Board place the Student at the Connecticut Center for Child Development (CCCD)
for the 2015-2016 school year at public expense?

3. Is the Student entitled to Compensatory Education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the
Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and
Connecticut General Statutes §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the
Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year. The Parents
requested placement at CCCD for the 2015-2016 school year. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On July 28, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. An impartial
hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on July 29, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was held on August 4,
2015. The parties agreed to forego a resolution meeting and mediate the matter. The mediation date
was pending.

At the October 26, 2015 hearing date, the Parent’s attorney withdrew the matter with prejudice. There
was no objection by the Board. The mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is November 9,
2015.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school distn'ct responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take

' action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the

ﬁndings or prescn'ption of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing oﬁ‘icer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
