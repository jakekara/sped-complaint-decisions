F INAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Are the Psychological and Occupational Therapy Evaluations conducted by the Board
appropriate? If not;

2. Should the Board conduct independent Psychological and Oecupationa1Therapy
Evaluations at public expense?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student is not identiﬁed as entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education
(FAPE) as deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20
U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and
placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents disagreed with the Psychological and Occupational
Therapy Eva1uations conducted by the Board and requested independent evaluations. The Board
denied the Parents’ request and requested a due process hearing pursuant to the provisions of 34
CFTR. §300.502(b)(2)(i).

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on June 24, 2105 and a pre—hearing conference was
held on J une, 30, 2015. A mediation session was held on August 17, 2015 but was unsuccessful.

Hearing dates of September 21 and 29, 2015 were chosen by the parties; the September 21, 2015,
hearing date was cancelled at the request of the Board’s attorney. There was no objection by the
Parents. At the September 29, 2015 hearing, the parties advised the hearing ofﬁcer that an
agreement had been ratiﬁed. The Parents withdrew their request for independent evaluations
with prejudice and the Board withdrew their request for due process. The date for the mailing of
the Final Decision and Order was extended to October 7, 2015 to accommodate the hearing date.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the

ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
