FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Did the Board violate “child ﬁnd” by not identifying the Student as requiring special education and
related services as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act
(IDEA)?

2. Was the program offered by the Board from November 12, 2015 to the end of the 2015-2016
school year appropriate and did it provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education
(FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE)?

3. Is the program offered by the Board for the 2016-2017 school appropriate and does it provide the
Student with FAPE in the LRE? If not;

4. Does the unilateral placement of the Student at Windward School for the 2016-2017 school year
provide a meaningful education?

5. Should the Board be responsible for the cost of the placement at Windward School for the 2016-
2017 school year?

6. Should the Board reimburse the Parents for the cost of the August 2015 Psychological Evaluation
performed by Dr. Beitel?

7. Is the Student entitled to compensatory education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student is classiﬁed with Multiple Disabilities and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the
Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and
Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the
Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2016—2017 school year and requested
reimbursement for their placement at Windward School for the 2016-2017 school year. The Board
refused the Parents’ request. On October 7, 2016, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for
due process. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on October 11, 2016 and a pre-hearing

conference was held on October 13, 2016. A hearing date of December 13, 2016 was chosen by the
parties. The parties agreed to forego a resolution meeting and mediate the matter.

At the December 13, 2016 hearing date, the panties were able to resolve the matter and requested
additional time to ﬁnalize the agreement. In an electronic transmission the Parents’ attorney informed

mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to December 23, 2016 to accommodate the
parties’ mediation.
