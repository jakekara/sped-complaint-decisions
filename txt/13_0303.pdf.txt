Hearing Ofﬁcer

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Whether the hearing ofﬁcer shall override the Parents’ lack of consent to the Board’s
requested evaluations so that the Board may proceed with the evaluations identiﬁed at the
12/7/2012 PPT meeting with Board staff or a qualiﬁed outside evaluator selected by the

Board;

2. Whether the hearing ofﬁcer shall order that the Parents refrain from pursuing outside
evaluations before the Board has had an opportunity to obtain its evaluations as this may
prevent the selected evaluator from using preferred test instruments and, therefore,
interfere with the Board’s ability to obtain the most meaningful assessment.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:

This request for hearing was submitted by the Board on January 30, 2013 and a prehearing
conference convened on February 6, 2013. At the preheating conference, counsel for both
parties indicated that they were attempting to resolve the matter. The Board also indicated that
the second issue was moot as the Parents were already proceeding with evaluations.
Subsequently, Board counsel submitted notiﬁcation that the parties had reached an agreement
and the Board was withdrawing its request for hearing Therefore, this matter is dismissed.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED.
