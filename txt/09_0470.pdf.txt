Myers, M.A. (Clinical Psychology), J.D.,  Hearing Officer  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  This matter was commenced by request for due 
process (the &#64257;Request&#64258;) dated May 15, 2009 and received by the State of Connecticut Department of Education, Due Process Unit (&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;) on May 18, 2009.   The undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer on May 20, 2009.   
 The Request states that the Student is a 5 year old identified as IDEIA-eligible on the basis of autism.  The Request alleges that the Stude
nt was denied a Free a
nd Appropriate Public Education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) in the 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 school years because the Individualized Educational Plans (&#64257;IEPs&#64258;) developed by the District for the Student for those school years were neither appropriate nor appropriately implemented.  The Request alle
ges further that the Student&#8482;s IEP for the 2009/2010 school year is inappropriate.  The Request states that the Parents raised their concerns at IEP team meetings
 in 2007 on February 13, April 3, June 14 and September 18, in 2008 at IEP team meetings on February 7, April 10 and 
November 6, and in 2009 
at IEP team meetings 
on January 6 and May 1.  The District allegedly took 
the position at each of those meetings that the 
IEPs at issue were appropriate and being impl
emented appropriately and that the Student was 
progressing in his program.  
The Request asks that the Hearing Officer
 find that the IEPs for the 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 school years were &#64257;inappropriate&#64258; within the meaning of the IDEIA and that the IEP for 
the 2009/2010 school year is not appropriate within the meaning of the IDEIA.  The Request then 
identifies the following &#64257;remedial relief&#64258; sought
 by the Parents for these denials of FAPE:   1. An order that the Board retain an &#64257;indepe
ndent consultant acceptable to the family to 
help the PPT develop and implement an approp
riate program that is consistent with the 
reports of the McCarton Center and Dr. Weiss and includes car
efully coordinated direct one-to-one instruction at school and at home on a year-round
 basis (including
