FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as Other Health Impaired~Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder
(OHI—ADHD) and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”) as deﬁned in
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 UTS.C. §1401 et seq. and
Connecticut General Statute §10-76a. The Student is over the age of 18 and has given a general power
of attorney to his aunt to make all education decisions in his place. The Student’s attorney-in-fact
objected to the pending graduation of the Student. The Board refused the attorney-in-fact’s request.

On or about July 8, 201 1, the Board received notice of the attorney-in—fact’s request for due process. The
parties agreed to forego a resolution meeting and requested mediation. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was
appointed on July 14, 2011 and a pre—hearing conference was held on July 19, 201 1. At the pre-hearing,
the Board objected to the sufﬁciency of the attorney—in—fact’s request for due process. The attorney-in-
fact agreed to amend the request and another pre-hearing conference was scheduled for July 27, 2011.
At the July 27, 2011 pre-hearing conference the Student’s attorney informed the panties that a matter
was pending before the Ofﬁce of Civil Rights that could affect the request for due process. The attorney
requested that they be allowed to withdraw the request for due process without prejudice. The Board did
not object to the request and the request for withdrawal was granted. The date for mailing the Final

Order and Decision is September 12, 201 1.
.FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
