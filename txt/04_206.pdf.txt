Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUE:  Whether the Board properly determined that the Student is eligible for special education 
under the eligibility category of Emotional Disturbance, such that special education 
services can be provided to him. 
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  The Board requested this hearing on July 2, 2004.  The mailing date of the decision was 
extended at the Board&#8482;s request, and absent objection from the Parent.  The first hearing 
date was scheduled for September 2, 2004. 
 At the September 2 hearing, the Board attorney appeared, but the Parent was not present.  
The Board attorney reported that the Board had been informed that the Parent was 
hospitalized on the date of the hearing, and also noted that there were some questions 
regarding the Student&#8482;s residency.  The Board attorney requested an extension of the 
mailing date of the decision at the hearing, and the matter was continued to September 23 
to ensure that the Parent had an opportunity to appear at the hearing, and for the Board to determine if the Student continued to be a resident of the Board&#8482;s district. 
 At the hearing on September 23, the Parent appeared with two family members for the 

hearing.  Representatives of the Board and the Board attorney also appeared at that hearing.  When the hearing commenced on that date, the Student&#8482;s aunt interrupted the 
proceedings, and was admonished that the interruptions were not appropriate during the
