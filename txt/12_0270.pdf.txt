ISSUES:

1. Did the Board err when the Planning and Placement Team determined that the Student no
longer needed special education services during the PPT meeting held December 5, 201 1 and

May 2, 2012 2 Final Decision and Order 12—0270

SUMMARY:

The Student has been enrolled in Wilcox Technical High School since entering as a
freshman in the 2008-2009 academic year. At the time Student entered high school, she had
already been identiﬁed as a child with a disability under the category of Other Health Impaired,
Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder and determined to be in need ofspecial education
services. The Board developed an IEP for the Student who received special education services
pursuant to the IEP, as modiﬁed from time to time, through the Board’s special education
program.

In April 201 1, at the end of Student’s eleventh grade year, the Board’s Planning and
Placement Team (PPT) recommended that it would be appropriate to exit Student from special
education based on the results of a triennial evaluation The Student’s Surrogate Parent, foster
parent, and social workers disagreed with the decision to exit and the PPT decided to retain the
Student in the special education program, and revisit the issue of exiting the Student at the
Student’s annual review in December of 201 1.

At the PPT meeting on December 15, 201 1, which was continued to January 19, 2012 the
PPT decided to exit the Student from special education. The Surrogate Parent, foster mother, and
social workers disagreed with the Board’s decision to exit the Student and the Surrogate Parent
requested a hearing pursuant to the requirements of 34 C.F.R. § 300.502.

FINDINGS OF FACT:

From a review of all documents entered on the record of the hearing and testimony
offered on behalf of the parties, I make the following Findings of Facts:

1. The Student was born on May 5, 1993 and is 18 years 01" age. Student has attended
Wilcox Technical High School for all four years of her high school program, (Exhibits B-l; B-5)

The May 12, 2010 IEP

3, The Student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), dated May 12, 2010, provided
that Student was to receive the following sewices in the regular classroom: four hours ol‘direct
instruction per technical week and six hours of co-taught instruction per academic week.
(Exhibit B-I) The IEP also provided that Student was to receive 3 hours per academic week of
strategic tutoring in a resource/related services room setting. (Exhibit B—1)These services were
needed to address Student’s identiﬁed goals of increasing comprehension and retention of
information for class tests and increasing test preparation skills. (Exhibit B—1)

4. In the May 12, 2010 IEP, PPT stated that the resource room component of Student’s IEP
was necessary to address Student’s weaknesses with working memory, reading and test—taking
skills. (Exhibit B—l)

May 2, 2012 3 Final Decision and Order 12—0270

51 In addition to direct instruction, the May 12, 2010 IEP also specified that Student should
receive accommodations in the form of extended time and alternate locations for testing, posting
of assignments and extra drills and testing. (Exhibit B-1)

6. Two goals related to transition were also identiﬁed in Student’s IEP: practicing needed
postsecondary education strategies and following trade 111163 and procedures. Student’s desires
and plans regarding transition were also discussed during the PPT meeting. (Exhibit B-1)

7. The PPT recommended a reevaluation which was planned for April 201 1, and which
would utilize the following measures: achievement, classroom obsewation, cognitive, social
emotional behavior, teacher repotts. The last evaluation had been conducted on April 7, 2008,
which meant that the April 201 1 evaluation would be a triennial evaluation for Student. (Exhibit
B-l)

The Triennial Evaluation and April 4 and April 7, 2011 PPT Meetings

8. As contemplated in the May 2010 IEP a triennial evaluation was conducted and a PPT
meeting held on April 4, 201 1. This meeting was adjourned due an absence of testing results and
reconvened on April 7, 201 1. The stated purpose of this meeting was to review 01‘1‘evise IEP,
conduct annual review, review reevaluation, transition planning and review cognitive and
behavioral testing which had been recently completed. (Exhibit B~2)

subject areas. Student’s science scores fell below her school’s average score, while her math
score exceeded it. (Exhibit B—2) A comparison of the CMT and CAPT scores showed growth of
two standard measures. (Testimony of Ms. Leib)

14. During the April 7, 201 1 meeting the school team raised the possibility of exiting the
Student from the special education program (Testimony of Foster Parent) Foster parent,
Surrogate Parent and Student’s social workers expressed concern over the Student’s educational
supports being removed and objected to exiting the Student in connection with perceived
difﬁculties with receptive and expressive communication and mental health issues. (Testimony

(Testimony of Ms. Leib; Exhibit B-2)

15. At the close of the April 7, 2011 PPT meeting, the PPT agreed to continue Student in
special education and significantly reduced the hours of services provided to the Student, The
IEP from the April 7, 201 1 PPT meeting speciﬁed that Student was to receive strategic tutoring
and transition sewices for .12 hours per academic week with the Guidance Counselor in his
ofﬁce. The IEP also speciﬁed that the Student was to receive Strategic Tutoring for Trade
Theory, Technology and Theory for .12 hours per technical week. This service was to be given
in the general education classroom. The designation of .12 hours works out to be roughly 6 or 7
minutes. The IEP also contains a statement that [Student] will repon to guidance for 10 minutes
a cycle to address self—advocacy and transition. (Testimony of Ms. Leib; Exhibit B—2)

16. The schedule of the Wilcox Technical School differs from that offered in traditional high
school setting, in that Students alternate between academic and technical cycles. (Testimony of

the guidance ofﬁce. (Testimony of Mr. Keith) During this same period the teacher providing
direct special educational services to the Student provided over ,12 minutes per cycle in services
to the Student. (Testimony of Ms. Sheehan)

The December 15, 2012 IEP

18. On December 15, 2011 the PPT convened for Student’s annual review. In accordance
with the April 7, 201 1 IEP, the December 15, 201 1 PPT meeting was to address issues of
transition and exiting the Student from special education. (Exhibit B—2) A discussion was held

Parent regarding the school team’s belief that Student’s disability did not negatively impact her

 

May 2, 2012 5 Final Decision and Order 12-0270

education, and she therefore does not need specialized instruction. (Exhibit B-2) Student’s foster
mother, Surrogate Parent, Institute of Professional Practice social worker, Depaltment of
Children and Families social worker and the Student disagreed with the team’s recommendation
that Student be exited from special education. A letter from the Student’s psychiatrist was
reviewed by the team (Exhibits B—2; P—l) Due to a scheduling issue for the Surrogate Parent,
the meeting was adjourned and scheduled to reconvene on January 19, 2012‘ (Exhibit B—2) In the
interim, the Surrogate Parent was requested by the PPT to generate a list of proposed goals and
objectives related to “self-advocacy” in order to address concerns she had regarding the existing
goals and objectives for review by the PPT at the January meeting. Oral repmts of the Student’s
progress toward objectives and goals were given, but no written reports submitted. (Testimony of

regarding communication, expressive and receptive language delays along with a thought
disorder that needs to be addressed. (Exhibit B-4) A list of new proposed goals and objectives
for the Student was tendered by the Surrogate Parent. The PPT declined to adopt the proposed
goals and objectives. (Testimony ot‘Foster Parent) The list of proposed goals and objectives
submitted at the January 2012 PPT was not offered into evidence and so the exact nature of what
was proposed is unknown.

May 2, 2012 6 Final Decision and Order 12-0270

Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (R.C.S.A.) § 10—7611—14 sets out the Burden of
Proofapplicable to this matter provides in relevant part: “...the public agency has the burden of
proving the appropriateness of the child’s program or placement, or of the program 01‘ placement
proposed by the public agency. This burden shall be met by a preponderance of the evidence...”

1. Section 10—76d—9 0f the R.C,S.A. requires that each child receiving special education and
related services shall be reevaluated at least once evely three years. 34 C.F.R. §300.303 contains
a parallel requirement. In order to be in compliance with Connecticut and Federal Regulations a
triennial evaluation of Student had to be completed by April 4, 201 1. (Findings 01‘ Fact 7) The
Board complied with these regulations. (Findings of Fact 8—13)

2. Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 300.305 (a)(2)(i)(B), the Board was required to examine whether
the child continued to have such a disability and the educational needs of the child, when
conducting its reevaluation. The Board was also required to examine whether the child continues
to need special education and related sewices. 34 C.F.R. § 300.305 (a)(2)(iii)(B).

3. The determination that the child was no longer eligible for special education made by the
Board after its reevaluation is at issue in this case. Pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1414(c)(4); 34 C.F.R.
§ 300305 (e) If a district believes that a student no longer requires special education 01‘ related
services, it must reevaluate the student in all areas of suspected disability. The district may exit
the child from special education if, aﬁer a comprehensive evaluation, it determines that the
student does not need services to obtain a meaningful educational beneﬁt. See Victor
Elementary Sch. Dist., 50 IDELR 204 (SEA CA 2008).

4. 34 CPR. §300.304(b) sets out the criteria for appropriate evaluation procedures. Under
34 C.F.R. §300.304 (b) (l) the Board is required to use a variety ofassessment tools and
strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental, and academic information about the
child, including information provided by the parent, that may assist in determining whether the
child is a child with a disability under 34 C.F.R, §300.8. As outlined in the April 7, 2011 IEP
documents, the Board utilized a variety of assessment tools and strategies when gathering
information for its eligibility decision. (Findings of Fact 9-13)

5. Under 34 C.F.R. §300.304(b)(2) the Board must not use a single measure or assessment
as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child with a disability and for
determining an appropriate educational program for the child. The Board relied on the content of
a number of different assessments and measures and identiﬁed several different bases for making
its eligibility determination. (Findings of Fact 19)

6. Under 34 CPR. § 300.304(b)(3) the Board is mandated to use technically sound
instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in
addition to physical or developmental factors. No claim has been made, nor evidence offered to
suggest that the instruments relied upon by the PPT in making their decision to exit the Student
were not sound.

7. Eligibility for special education as a student with Other Health Impairment, is governed
by 34 C.F.R. §300.8(b)(9). This section sets out a conjunctive test for eligibility. In order to

 

May 2, 2012 7 Final Decision and Order 12-0270

qualify under this section a student must have limited strength, vitality, or aleltness, including a
heightened alertness to environmental stimuli, that results in limited alertness with respect to the
educational environment. It must then be shown that such conditions are due to chronic or acute
health problems such as asthma, attention deﬁcit disorder or attention deﬁcit hyperactivity
disorder, diabetes, epilepsy, a heart condition, hemophilia, lead poisoning, leukemia, nephritis,
rheumatic fever, sick1e cell anemia and Tourette syndrome. Finally it must be shown that the
impairment adversely affects a child’s educational performance. 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(b)(9)(ii).

8. The assessments and evaluative measures relied upon by the PPT in making its eligibility
determination on January 19, 2012 showed that the Student had developed strategies to
compensate for her ADHD and that her disability was no longer adversely affecting her
educational performance. Standardized tests placed Student at the proﬁcient or goal levels in
major subject areas. (Findings of Fact 13) As evidenced by her academic transcript, despite a
near total reduction in her supports and services beginning in April 201 1, Student had continued
to succeed in the regular education curriculum throughout her senior year. (F indings 01‘ Fact15
and 22) Student was able to independently advocate for her interests. (Findings of Fact 23)

9. Student’s guidance counselor and special education teacher testiﬁed credibly that they
each had regularly provided to the Student the .12 hours of services during the academic and
technical cycles that were required in the April 7, 2011 IEP. (Findings of Fact15, 16 and 17) The
Surrogate Parent presented no evidence to establish that such services had not been provided,
either through documentation or testimony. The Surrogate Parent’s c1aim that services were not
provided to the Student is unsupported by the evidence.

The Final Decision and Order sets fotth the Hearing Ofﬁcer’s summary, ﬁndings of facts
and conclusions oflaw. The ﬁndings of facts and conclusions oflaw set forth herein, which
reference certain exhibits and witness testimony are not meant to exclude other supported
evidence in the record. All evidence presented was considered in deciding this matter. T0 the
extent that the summary, procedural histmy and ﬁndings of fact actually represent conclusions of
law, they shou1d be so considered by the Hearing Ofﬁcer and vice versa, SAS Institute, Inc. v.

Ind. Sch. Bd., 835 F. Supp. 340 (SD. Tex. 1993).

A11 motions and objections not previously ruled upon, if any, are hereby overruled.
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
1. The Board’s PPT did not err when it determined that the Student no longer needed
special education services during its December 5, 201 1 and January 19, 2012 meetings. As no

error occurred, the services and supports previously provided to Student pursuant to her April 4,
2011 IEP do not need to be reinstated.

2. Student was not denied a FAPE as a result of the PPT’s decision to exit the Student from
special education

 

May 2, 2012 8 Final Decision and Order 12-0270

3. Student was provided with the special education sewices speciﬁed in the April 4, 201 1
IEP and thus, no denial of FAPE occurred as a result of failure to provide such services.

The Board’s decision to exit the Student is upheld.
