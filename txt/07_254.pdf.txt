SUMMARY 
 The Student is a 20 year-old student at AC

The Student, also referred to as M., is a young 
man with multiple disabilities who has been 
attending ACES Village School a
nd ACES Whitney High East (ACE
S) an out-of-district school 
for severely disabled students since 1999.  He wa
s placed there while residing in Hartford.  In 
April 2006, his family moved to East Hartfor
d, which agreed to continue his educational 
placement at ACES while East Hartford staff obta
ined his records and evaluated his needs. At 
ACES, he has been assisted by a one-to-one parapr
ofessional.  He will graduate in June 2008, as 
he will be 21 years old on December 31, 
2007.  At the June 14, 2007 PPT, the team recommended that M. attend his final year of 
education in East Hartford High School&#8482;s (EHHS) 
self-contained special education class for medically
 fragile students (&#64257;Realities&#64258;), with a one-to-one paraprofessional, and pursue his transition planning for adult services from there.  It also recommended that he receive Extended School Y
ear (ESY) services in July 2007 at ACES, and that an East Hartford paraprofessional observe 
him there in preparation for the move to East 
Hartford.  This paraprofessional spent the last
 two weeks of ESY and the month of September
