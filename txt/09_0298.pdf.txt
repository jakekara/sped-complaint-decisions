 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  This matter was commenced by request for due pr
ocess dated January 13, 2009, directed to the Board&#8482;s Special Education Director.   The undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer on January 23, 2009.   Assuming that the Board received the requ
est for due process on January 14, 2009, absent modification by the Hearing Officer the date for ma
iling of the Final Decision and Order would have been March 30, 2009.  The request for due process indicates that the Student was an 8 year old 3
rd grader at the time the request was filed, that she has be
en diagnosed with Turner Syndrome and Specific 
Learning Disability, and that the Parents are challenging the District&#8482;s refusal at an IEP team meeting 
held on September 18, 2008 to fund a placement of the 
Student at Eagle Hill Sc
hool in Southport for the 2008/2009 school year.  The Board did not file an answer or a sufficiency challenge, and it does not appear from the materials submitted in this matter that a resolution meeting was convened.   
 
By notice dated February 6, 2009, a telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) was scheduled for 
February 24, 2009.  Each party participated in the PHC through counsel.  Both parties indicated an interest in attempting to resolve their dispute by se

and as reflected in a scheduling order issued on 
February 25, 2009, the date for mailing of the Final 
Decision and Order was extended through and including May 15, 2009 and a second PHC was 

scheduled for April 10, 2009.  Hearing dates were set for April 27, 2009 and May 5, 2009 and a schedule for the exchange of witness lists and records was established.  As reflected in the February 25,
