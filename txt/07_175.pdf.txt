ISSUES 
 
 I. Whether the IEP for the 2007-2008 which provides for assistive technology, 
should extend the use of the technology to the child&#8482;s preschool setting to help the child reach educational goals and objectives ?  
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
The parent requested a due process hearing on June 22, 2007.  At a prehearing conference on June 27, 2007, the parties requested an extension of the date for final decision to permit time to mediate the matter. The pare
nt did not attend a hearing scheduled for September 4, 2007 and another hearing date es
tablished on the record for September 20, 
2007.  The Attorney for the board of education believes the parent does not intend to 

pursue the due process hearing at this time 
and request the matter be dismissed without 
prejudice.  The matter is concluded prior 
to the date for mailing final decision as 
extended by agreement of the 
parties and on the record.
