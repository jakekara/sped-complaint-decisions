Appearing Before:    Attorney Ru

ISSUE:   Was the Student receiving a free appropriate public education as required by the Individuals With Disabilitie
s Education Act, 20 U.S.C.&#167; 1402 et seq. and Connecticut General Statutes &#167; 10-76a for the school year 2008-2009 ?  
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
   On October 15, 2008 the undersigned was assi
gned to hear this matter pursuant to 
a parental request for a due process hearing. The Student was initially represented by her 
mother. The City was represented by Melinda Kauffman, Assistant Corporation Counsel. 
A notice pertaining to the scheduling of a pre-hearing conference was sent to both parties on October 21, 2008.  
 The Parent contacted the he
aring officer personally and notified him that she was 
in the process of obtaining legal representation and wanted to hold the pre-hearing conference when she had obtained said representation. As of the second week of November 2008 Attorney Lynn Cochrane of Greater Hartford Legal Aid agreed to 

represent the Parent and her daughter. At that time Attorney Cochrane requested a few 

weeks to review her file and her request was granted without objection.   After reviewing the file Attorney Cochra
ne concluded that the Student&#8482;s &#64257;special 
education needs appeared more extensive than
 that covered by the single issue raised by the Parent in her request for due process&#64258;. Accordingly Attorney Cochrane asked for 
additional time to &#64257;meet as a PPT, make 
additional recommendations for evaluations 
(including an independent educational evaluation) and compensatory education, and then 
re-meet (as a PPT) to revise her IEP&#64258;. 
Thereafter, on January 12, 2009 Attorney
