   Attorney Patricia M. Strong, Hearing Officer FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
ISSUES: 1. Did the Board offer a free appropriate public education to the Student for the 2009 extended school year and the 2009-2010 school year? 2. If not, should the Board be required to place the Student at Foundation School for both periods of time and/or reimburse the Parents 
for the costs of tuition and placement there? 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
The Parents&#8482; attorney faxed a letter to the State Department of Education ("SDE") on July 2, 2009 
requesting a due process hearing. The Board received 
a copy of the letter on July 6, 2009.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on July 8, 2009. A pr
ehearing conference was held on July 21, 2009.  The parties&#8482; attorneys requested hearin
g dates in late September because they had scheduled mediation on 
August 26, 2009. Hearing dates were agreed on 
for September 21, 2009 and September 30, 2009.  The 
September 21, 2009 mailing date for the final decision 
was extended to October 26, 2009 at the request of 
the Parents&#8482; attorney.   
On August 28, 2009, the SDE advised the Hearing 
Officer that the parties had reached an agreement at the August 26, 2009 mediation and that the 
Parents&#8482; attorney would advise her on the status of the hearing request. On September 18, 2009 the Parent
s&#8482; attorney filed a withdrawal of the due process request without prejudice because the final agreemen
t had not been executed and requested that the 
September 21, 2009 hearing be canceled.  The Heari
ng Officer canceled both hearing dates.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
It is ordered that this case shall be dismissed without prejudice.
