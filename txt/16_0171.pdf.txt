FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Is the program provided by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year appropriate and does it
provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE)? If not;

2. Should the Board place the Student at the Beacon School, at Greenwich Education Group in
Stamford, CT, with services provided by the Collaborative Center for the 2015-2016 school year
in order to receive FAPE in the LRE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the
Individuals With Disabilities Education Act(1DEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General
Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and p1acement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the
program offered to the Student for the 2015-2016 school year. The Parents requested placement at the
Beacon School at Greenwich Education Group in Stamford, Connecticut with services provided by the
Collaborative Center for the 2015-2016 school year. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On September 25, 2015, the Board received notice of the Student’s request for due process. An
impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on September 25, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was held
on October 5, 2015. The parties agreed to attend a mediation on December 4, 2015. In an electronic
transmission dated December 21, 2015, the hearing ofﬁcer was advised that the matter had been
resolved but an agreement had not been fully executed. The Parents’ attorney withdrew the matter
without prejudice. There was no objection by the Board. The mailing date of the Final Decision and
Order was extended to January 8, 2016 to accommodate the mediation.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISSMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
