PROCEDURAL HISTORY: This hearing was requested on October 1, 2009, and the Hearing Officer was appointed on October 5, 2009. At a brief pre-hearing conference on November
 24, 2009, it was agreed that the Parties would request mediation, and as requeste
d, the Hearing Officer extended the decision date from December 15, 
2009, to January 14, 2010. Mediation was schedule
d for December 21, 2009, but was postponed to 
February 18, 2010. SUMMARY: In order to comply with the confidentiality requireme
nts of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
of 1974, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1232g and related regulations at 34 C.F.R. &#167; 99, the following decision uses &#64257;Student&#64258;, &#64257;School&#64258;, &#64257;Parent&#64258;, and t
itles of school staff members and 
other witnesses in place of names 
and other personally identifiable information.  
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: 
Section 10-76h-9 (e), Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, provid
es for one 30-day extension of the decision date to provide for settlement negotiations,
 which may include mediation.  Because the Parties 
have provided no request for further extension of the decision date, which would have to include 
substantial reasons for a second extension, this matter is DISMISSED 
without prejudice.
