FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUE:
Whether the psychological evaluation administered by the Board was appropriate.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:

The prehearing conference initially convened on May 21, 2012. At the ﬁrst prehearing conference, the Parent’s
attorney was ready to proceed, but the Board’s attorney was not available and not present for the conference. A
second preheating conference convened on May 23, 2012 as a courtesy to counsel.

The request for hearing, dated May 14, 2012 was received by the Parent’s attorney on May 23, 2012 the date of
the second preheating conference. At the prehearing conference, the Board’s attorney indicated that he thought
a copy had been fomarded to the Parent or Parent’s attorney on May 14, 2012 but was not able to verify that
that had been done.

On May 25, 2012 the Board’s attorney submitted notiﬁcation that the Board was withdrawing the second issue
in the request for hearing. That issue, regarding whether the Board’s program offered at the Februaly 29, 2012
PPT provided the Student with FAPE in the least restrictive environment, was withdrawn at that time.

At the preheating conference, and as was noted in the Notice of Hearing Date, the Board’s attorney was ordered
to submit the Student’s most recent IBP and the most recent evaluations on or before May 25, 2012. Despite
several reminders that the exhibits had not been received after the due date, the Board’s attomey failed to

comply with the hearing ofﬁcer’s order.

After business hours on May 30, 2012 prior to the ﬁrst hearing date, the Board’s attorney submitted notiﬁcation
that the Parent had withdrawn his demand for an independent evaluation which rendered the Board’s hearing
request “no longer necessary and, in fact, moot” Therefore, this matter is dismissed.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED.
