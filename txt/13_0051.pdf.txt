process hearing date for September 20, 2012. The parties agreed to participate in
mediation and subsequently requested a 30 day extension to accommodate a September
14, 2012 mediation date. The date for the ﬁnal decision and order was extended to
November 6, 2012. The September 20, 2012 due process hearing date was subsequently
cancelled and re—scheduled for October 22, 2012, with the date for the ﬁnal decision and
order extended until December 6, 2012. On October 9, 2012 the Parents filed a Motion
for Telephonic Testimony, to which the Board objected. The October 22, 2012 hearing
date was utilized to allow the parties to argue the Motion for Telephonic T estimony
which was subsequently denied. A hearing date was scheduled for November 9, 2012.
Due to weather related issues, the November 9, 2012 due process hearing date was
cancelled and re—scheduled to November 19, 2012. At the November 19, 2012 hearing
date, the panties reached a tentative agreement, and requested time to formalize the
agreement in writing. A hearing date was set for December 18, 2012. The parties did not
have a formalized agreement by December 18, 2012 and requested additional time to
formalize the agreement. A hearing date was set for January 7, 2013 to have the matter
withdrawn due to the agreement, go fowvard with the hearing 01‘ have the matter
dismissed without prejudice. On January 6, 2013, counsel for the Parents notiﬁed the
Hearing Ofﬁcer that there was no written agreement in place, that in anticipation of
having a written agreement counsel had scheduled other matters for January 7 and as a
result, he would not be present for the hearing date, but was reserving the Parents’ right
to re—ﬁle the complaint if necessary, On January 7, 2013, with none of the parties present
at the hearing, and having received no communication from counsel for the Board, the
matter was dismissed without prejudice.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

Pursuant to the Parties having indicated that an agreement had been reached but not
formalized on November 19, 2012, and having provided the panties with over a month
to formalize the agreement or continue with the hearing, and being informed that the
agreement had not been formalized and then subsequently having no patty appear for
the scheduled hearing date on January 7, 2013, the matter is dismissed without
prejudice.
