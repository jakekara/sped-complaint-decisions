November 22. The original deadline for mailing the ﬁnal decision and order was January 6,
2011.

appeared on behalf of Student and Attorney Chinni appeared on behalf of BOB. The following
issue was identiﬁed: Shall BOE be permitted to conduct a psychiatric evaluation of Student prior
to addressing Student’s Parents’ request for an independent educational evaluation?

On December 6, Student’s Attorney moved to dismiss the due process request on the
basis that 1) the request is moot because Student’s Parents did not revoke consent for evaluation
and 2) that the request is premature because BOE did not hold a resolution session prior to ﬁling
for due process. BOE’s Attorney was notiﬁed that she had until December 13 to ﬁle an
objection. No objection was ﬁled. After fully considering the positions of the parties, the motion
to dismiss was denied,
