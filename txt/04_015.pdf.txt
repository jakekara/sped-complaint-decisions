February 17, 2004 -1- Final Decision and Order 04-015    STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION    Student  v.  Plainfield Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parents:  Mother, pro se  Appearing on behalf of the Board:  Attorney Susan Gundersen Sullivan, Schoen, Campane & Connon, LLC 646 Prospect Avenue Hartford, CT   06105-4286  Appearing before:    Attorney Patricia M. Strong Hearing Officer    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   PROCEDURAL HISTORY   This hearing was requested on January 20, 2004.  This hearing officer was assigned to the case on January 21.  A prehearing conference was held on January 29.  The issue presented by the Mother was a disagreement with the placement of the student in a public school.  The Parent requested a residential placement.  At that time the Board's attorney suggested requesting additional time for mediation.  The Parent would not agree to extend the decision deadline for mediation.  She stated that she planned to have an attorney from Conn. Legal Services available to her in February.  Hearing dates were agreed on for March 1, 3 and 4.  On February 12, the Hearing Officer received a letter from the Mother dated February 8 in which she stated:  "I would like to stop the due process hearing for [Student].  As of now I do not have an attorney."    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  Although the Parent's request to "stop" the hearing did not specify whether she wished to withdraw the case, it is apparent that she does not wish to prosecute it further.  It is ordered that the case shall be dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Regulations of Conn. State Agencies, Section 10-76h-18(a)(1).
