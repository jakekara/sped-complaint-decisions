PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

 The parents, through counsel, requested a due process hearing on or about August 15, 2008.  On August 27, 2008, the Board of Education filed a Sufficiency Challenge, stating 
the compliant fails to state a proposed reso
lution pursuant to 34 C.F. R. &#167; 300.508(b)(6). On September 3, 2008, the parents through couns
el filed, Objection to the Sufficiency Challenge, stating the complaint contains the requisite proposed resolution.  At a prehearing conference on September 5, 2008, couns
el for the parents clarified the Board of Education had not received a full copy of the complaint.  It was then decided the 
complaint met the statutory and regulatory 
requirements. The parties requested time to 
pursue mediation in the matter.  The mediati
on was scheduled for the first day of hearing. The parties requested postponement of the sc
heduled hearing date, which was granted.  The parties were able to reach
 settlement prior to the sche
duled hearing date, and request 
the matter be dismissed with prejudice. The matte
r was resolved within forty-five days as 
extended to schedule mediation.
