convened on November 30, 2012. The patties mediated the case on December 7, 2012. On December
12, 2012 the Parents’ attorney submitted notiﬁcation that the patties did not resolve the matter at
mediation, but that the Parents had initiated a neuropsychological evaluation of the Student which will
not be completed until February. Due to scheduling difﬁculties, the Parents’ attorney requested that the
Parents withdraw the request for due process, without prejudice. Therefore, this matter is dismissed.
