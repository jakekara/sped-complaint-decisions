FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
A special education hearing in the above-captioned matter was requested by the Student via 
Request for Impartial Special Education Hearing da
ted August 17, 2009. The Board of Education received the request on August 25, 2009. Therefore, the 30-day resolution period ran through September 24, 2009.  
The deadline for mailing the final decision and order 
is November 8, 2009. The issue identified in the 
request for hearing is whether the Board of Education failed to implement Student&#8482;s IEP. 
The parties participated in mediation on Sept
ember 8, 2009, prior to a 
pre-hearing conference being scheduled. On September 11, 2009, the Hearing O
fficer was notified by the Due Process Unit that the parties reached an agreemen
t at mediation and that the 
pro se
 Parent would advise the Hearing Officer 
on the status of the hearing request. In light of that communicati
on, a pre-hearing conference was not scheduled. On September 24, 2009, the H
earing Officer notified the parties that a pre-hearing conference would be scheduled if a written request to
 withdraw was not received by October 2, 2009. 
A written request to withdraw was not received 
so the matter was scheduled for a pre-hearing 
conference on October 19, 2009 with an indication that it would be cancelled if a written request to withdraw was received by October 18, 2009. On October 16, the Parent e-mailed the Hearing Officer 
indicating that the request for hearing had already been withdrawn and requested that the pre-hearing conference be cancelled. 
In light of the above facts, the above-captioned case is hereby dismissed with prejudice.
