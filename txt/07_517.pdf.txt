DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
  Student v. Farmington Board of Education 
 
Appearing on behalf of the Parent: Parent appeared 
Pro Se  
Appearing on behalf of the Board of Education: Attorney Craig Meuser, Chinni & Meuser, LLC, 30 Avon Meadow Lane, Avon, CT 06001 
 
Appearing before: Attorney Elisabeth Borrino, Hearing Officer  
  ISSUES:  1. Whether the Board failed to provide prope
r Notice of the April 30, 2008 Planning and Placement Team (&#64257;PPT&#64258;) meeting to the Pare
nt and of the PPT meetings thereafter; 
 
2. Whether the Hearing Offi
cer lacks jurisdiction.   
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  This matter is before the Hearing Officer pursua
nt to the Parent&#8482;s request for a Due Process Hearing on May 20, 2008.  A pre-hearing conference was held on June 18, 2008.  
By way of letter dated May 30, 2008, the Board f
iled a Motion to Dismiss the matter asserting 

lack of jurisdiction.  The Hearing Officer denied the motion 
without prejudice.  
By way of letter erroneously dated July 14, 2008, 
received July 8, 2008, the Parent requested a continuance of the Due Process Hearing in order to obtain the testimony of a witness who was on 
vacation.  The request  was denied.  The hearing was held on July 11, 2008.  The Board renewed 
its Motion to Dismiss.  Ruling on the motion wa
s deferred until after the Parent presented her 
case. Witnesses called by the Parent included the Pa
rent and Dr. Jane H. Currie. The Parent again 
requested that the hearing be continued for the testimony of
 a Board employee.  The Hearing 
Officer requested an offer of proof as to the anticipated testimony of the intended witness in order to determine whether the Parent would be
 prejudiced by the inability to present such 
evidence and testimony.  Having done
 so, setting aside that the Parent had not confirmed with 
the witness that she would so testify as anticipated, the Hearing Officer found that the evidence and testimony, even if produced, would not be 
dispositive of any issue framed in these 
proceedings.  Accordingly, the Hearing Officer de
nied the Parent&#8482;s request and finds that the 
Parent is not prejudiced thereby.
