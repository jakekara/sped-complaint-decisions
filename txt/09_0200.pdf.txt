 I. Whether the Student requires a one-to-one aide in order to receive a free and appropriate public education? 
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

 
The Parent through counsel requested a due process hearing on November 13, 2008. The 
parent requested an expedited hearing.  Parent&#8482;s counsel again requested the matter be 
scheduled for expedited hearing by motion dated November 19, 2008.  Counsel for the 

Board of Education filed a Motion in Oppos
ition to the Motion for Expedited Hearing on 
November 20, 2008.  Parent&#8482;s counsel replie
d to the Motion in Opposition on November 

21, 2008, claiming request for due process was 
subject to the provisions of 34 C.F.R. &#167;300.352.  Counsel for the Board of Education argued, any removal from school was the 

action of the private school in which the pa
rents unilaterally placed the child. The Board 
of Education claimed the provisions of 34 
C.F.R. &#167; 300.530 do not apply to the present circumstances.  Parent&#8482;s counsel requested 
consideration of additional factors by reply 
received December 1, 2008.  The ruling on th
e Motion for Expedited Hearing issued 
December 4, 2008, found the matter was subject 
to the timelines provided in 34 C.F.R. &#167; 
300.515.  The Motion for Expedited Hearing was denied.  At a prehearing conference on November 20, 2008 the parties agreed the firs
t day of hearing would be January 6, 2009, if they were unable to resolve the matter in 
mediation.  The parties proceeded to mediate 
the matter on December 16, 2008.  On Decem
ber 26, 2008 the parent withdrew the 
matter.  The matter is hereby dismissed.  The matter was resolved within 45 days from 

the date of the request for due process.
