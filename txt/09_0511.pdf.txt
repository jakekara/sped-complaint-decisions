 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  This matter was commenced by request for due pr
ocess dated June 11, 2009 filed by the Student&#8482;s mother (the &#64257;Mother&#64258;) on behalf of the Student.  The undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer on June 17, 2009.  The Student attends an out-of-district placement and the Mother sought a hearing 
challenging the decision of District staff at an IEP team meeting 
in June 2009 regarding extended school year (&#64257;ESY&#64258;) services for the Student for the summer 
of 2009 at the out-of-district placement.  There is 
no dispute regarding the Student&#8482;s eligibility for special education and related services under the IDEIA and Connecticut&#8482;s special education laws, Conn. Gen. Stat.  &#167; 10-76h, et seq.    No sufficiency challenge or answer was filed, and a resolu
tion session was not convened.  A telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) was not convened.  Assuming that the du
e process request was received on June 5, 2009, the date for mailing of the Final Decision and Order, in
 due course and absent modification by the Hearing Officer, would have been August 18, 2009. In scheduling the PHC, the Hearing Officer was advised by Ms. Osypuk that the IEP team&#8482;s decision 
regarding ESY services being cha
llenged by the Mother reflected lack of documentation at the time of 
the IEP meeting, that the District had subsequently
 received the requested documentation, and that on 
review of the documentation, the Dist
rict had determined to provide 
the requested ESY services.  The 
Mother requested several days to review the services the District proposed to offer and subsequently advised by e-mail that she was satisfied with the se
rvices the District was offering and that she was withdrawing her request.  The District is commended for its attenti
on and quick response to assure continuity of service for the Student. 
 
Accordingly, this matter is hereby DISMISSED.
