 Appearing on behalf of the Parents:    
pro se  Appearing on behalf of the Board of Education:  pro se  Appearing before:      Attorney Deborah R. Kearns 
Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  I. Whether the individualized education program proposed by the local 
educational agency (LEA) which plans to return the child to the home school 
provides the child with a free and appropriate public education? 
 II. Whether a change to the child&#8482;s reading program which differs from the 
child&#8482;s current program in the way the program is delivered renders the 

program inappropriate for the child? 
  PROCEDURAL HISTORY   The matter was assigned for an advisory opinion on October 21, 2005.   The parent did 
not want to participate in the advisory opinion process.  The special education hearing convened on November 22, 2005. The mother father, aunt, principal of the child&#8482;s current 

school and interim-principal of the child&#8482;s home school testified at the hearing. The 
record closed upon receipt of the transcript on January 2, 2006.  The written date for mailing the final decision is January 20, 2006. 
  SUMMARY  On October 19, 2005 the parent filed a request for an impartial special education hearing 

to dispute the local educational agency (LEA) proposal to return the child to the home 
school as the site where she will receive her special education program.  The parent 
claims the child will be educated with neighborhood peers and her sibling, who are 
triggers for her inappropriate behavior; and the home school uses a reading program that 
differs from the one the child receives at the current placement within the LEA school 

district.  The parent claims both issues make the child&#8482;s program inappropriate.
