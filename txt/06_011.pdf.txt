conference was scheduled for January 26, 2006.  The issues included transition goals, 
amount of services, termination of related services and payment issues.  Both parties 

participated in the prehearing conference.   The Board indicated that the Student was eighteen years old and if there was to be a due process hearing the Student would have to file the request.  The Parent, who was the moving party, indicated she wanted to 

withdraw her request for due process as the Board had proposed a plan that the Parent 
was willing to try.    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The hearing is dismissed.
