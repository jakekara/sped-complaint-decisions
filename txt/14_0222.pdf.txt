FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Is the program proposed by the Board for the 2013-2014 school year appropriate and does it provide the
Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE)?
If not;

2. Is the unilateral placement of the Student at Cooke Center Academy for the 2013—2014 school year
appropriate and does it provide a meaningful education?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals With
Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §l401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10—
76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program offered by the
Board for the 2013-2014 school year. The Parents requested placement at Cooke Center Academy for the 2013—
2014 school year. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On October 15, 2013, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The parties agreed to
forgo a resolution meeting and mediate the matter. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on October 17,
2013 and a pre-hearing conference was held on October 22, 2013. A hearing date of December 2, 2013 was

chosen by the parties.

In an electronic transmission the parties requested cancelation of the hearing date because the matter had been
resolved. Thee parties requested additional time in order to ﬁnalize an agreement. In an electronic transmission
dated December 4, 2013, the patties advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the agreement had been signed by all
parties. The Parents’ attorney withdrew the matter with prejudice. The date for the mailing of the Final
Decision and Order is December 28, 2013.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

T HE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days aﬁer
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the

ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
