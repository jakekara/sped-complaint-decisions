 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  The Parent (Father) requested this hearing by faxi
ng a request for an impartial hearing on May 29, 
2009 to the State Department of Ed
ucation ("SDE").  This Hearing 
Officer was assigned to the case on 
June 5, 2009.  On June 9, 2009, the Hearing Officer sent a prehearing conference notice to the Parties and a 
copy of the due process complaint fo
r the Board&#8482;s attorney.  On June 
10, 2009, the Board&#8482;s attorney filed 
an appearance and requested that the prehearing 
conference be rescheduled.  On June 16, 2009, a 
prehearing conference was held.  It wa
s determined that the Board of E
ducation received a copy of the due 
process request on June 9, 2009.  The mailing date for 
the final decision was set at August 24, 2009.  A 
hearing date was agreed on for July 15, 2009.  On J
une 24, 2009, the Board&#8482;s atto
rney filed a Motion to 
Dismiss or in the Alternative for a More Definite St
atement.  On June 25, 2009, the Hearing Officer ruled 
that the complaint was insufficient because it did not 
state the nature of the pr
oblem of the child or a 
proposed resolution of the problem to the extent 
known.  The Parent was allowed 30 days to file a 
resubmitted hearing notice.  On July 9, 2009, the Hearin
g Officer advised the parties that the July 15, 2009 
hearing was canceled and that the Parent&#8482;s resubmitte
d hearing notice should be filed by July 27, 2009 or 
the hearing would be dismissed for failure to prosecute
.  The Parent did not comply with this order or 
communicate with the Hearing Officer. 
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
  It is ordered that this 
case shall be dismissed.
