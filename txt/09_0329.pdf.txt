Appearing before:    Attorney De
borah R. Kearns, Hearing Officer  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 ISSUES  1. Whether the Board provides the Student with an appropriate special education program? 
2. If not, whether the parent should be reimbur
sed for the costs of two out-of-district placements? 
  PROCEDURAL HISTORY  The parent, through counsel, requested a Due Pro
cess hearing by letter to the Connecticut State 
Department of Education - Due Process Unit on
 February 16, 2009. The matter was assigned to the 
hearing officer on February 20, 2009. The hearing re
quest claims the Board offered a program that 
was not appropriate to meet the 
Student&#8482;s needs in the least restrictive environment. The parent 
unilaterally placed the Student in 
two, out-of-district placements. The parent claims the programs meet 
the Student&#8482;s special education needs. The parent seeks reimbursement of the cost for the Student&#8482;s 

diagnostic placement and the cost of the current pl
acement. The parent claims the out-of-district 
placement should continue to be the Student&#8482;s 
placement for the 2008-2009 school year. The parties 
requested time to pursue settlement discussions.
