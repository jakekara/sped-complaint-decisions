FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
: The Student is a 14 year old student who has been identified as Other Health Impaired and is entitled 
to receive a free and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE
&#64258;) as defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. At a PPT meeting, the Parents rejected the pr
ogram offered by the Board for the 
2009-2010 
school year. The Parents requested that the Student be placed
 at a therapeutic residential progr
am. The Board refused the Parent&#8482;s 
request. On or about February 1, 2010, the Board received notice of the Parent&#8482;s request for due process. Mediation was held on March 29, 2010 and the pa
rties were unable to reach an agreement. 
 An impartial hearing officer was appointed on 
February 4, 2010 and a pre-hearing conference was held on February 22, 2010. Hearing dates of April 27, 28, 30, 2010 and May 4, 6 and 7, 2010 were chosen by the parties. The April 30, May 4 and 6, 2010 hearing dates were
 cancelled by the parties and additional hearing 
dates of May 17, 18 and 20, 2010 were chosen by the parties. After a brief recess, on the third hearing date, 
May 7, 2010, the Parent&#8482;s attorney advised the hearing officer that the matter was resolved. The parties 
informed the hearing officer that the 
hearing was withdrawn with prejudice.
