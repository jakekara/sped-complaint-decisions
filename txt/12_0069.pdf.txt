FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Emotional Disturbance and is entitled to receive a free and
appropriate public education (FAPE) as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a. At a PPT
meeting, the Parents requested continued placement of the Student at Ben Bronz Academy. The Board

refused the Parents’ request.

On August 16, 201 1 a hearing ofﬁcer was appointed. A recusal was ﬁled by the Hearing Ofﬁcer.
Another impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on August 26, 2011, and a prevhearing conference was
scheduled for September 2, 2011‘ Hearing dates of September 22 and October 4, 2011 were chosen by
the patties. On or about September 8, 2011, the Board requested that the matter be withdrawn since the
placement the Student was seeking would not accept the Student. The Parents also requested a
clariﬁcation on stay put. The Board’s request for withdrawal was denied and a stay put order was

issued.

The matter was mediated by the parties and a resolution was agreed to by the parties. The Board
requested a withdrawal without prejudice; the request was granted. The date for the mailing of the Final
Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the mediation and the hearing dates. The mailing
date for the Final Decision and Order is November 9, 201 11

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
