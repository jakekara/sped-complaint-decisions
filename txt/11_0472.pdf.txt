FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUE:

Parent has requested reimbursement for educational expenses.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This hearing was requested by Parent on May 31, 201 l. The Hearing Ofﬁcer was
appointed on June 6, 201 1. The date for mailing the decision is August 14, 201 1.

By letter dated June 6, 2011, the Board ﬁled a challenge to the sufﬁciency of the Parent’s
request for a hearing, citing the lack of an address for the Student, the name of the school
the Student is currently attending, an educational issue in dispute and a proposed remedy
or resolution. The Hearing Ofﬁcer reviewed the request for hearing, conﬁrming that the
information cited by the Board had not been provided by Parent. The Hearing Ofﬁcer
sent a response to the Sufﬁciency Challenge to both Parties on June 7, 201 I. The Parent
was informed that a re-submitted request could be ﬁled if it was received by the Hearing

Ofﬁcer prior to July 7, 2011.

The Hearing Ofﬁcer has received no further communication from the Parent.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The request for hearing having been found insufﬁcient, and no response from the Parent
to correct such insufﬁciencies having been received, this matter is DISMISSED without

prejudice
