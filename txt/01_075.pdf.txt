May 17, 2002 -1- Final Decision and Order 01-075  STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION     Student v. Easton Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parents: Parents appeared pro se  Appearing on behalf of the Board: Attorney Marsha Belman Moses      Berchem, Moses & Devlin, P.C.      75 Broad Street      Milford, Connecticut 06460  Appearing before:   Attorney Justino Rosado, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUES:   1. Is the educational evaluation provided by the Board appropriate? If not,   2. Should the Board be required to pay for an independent psychological, speech and language and occupational therapy evaluations of the student?   SUMMARY:   The student is an eight and &#189; years-old young man who has been diagnosed as learning disabled and eligible for special education and related services as defined on 20 U.S.C. Section1401 et. seq. The Board requested a due process hearing because the parents requested reimbursements for independent psychological, occupational therapy and speech and language evaluations. The Board felt that these evaluations were not necessary and would not pay for them and that the evaluations performed by the Board were appropriate.   The student&#8482;s mother on April 5, 2001, sent a letter to the Board and the Hearing Officer withdrawing her request for reimbursement of the evaluations. The Board would not withdraw their request for a due process hearing, since the first issue was still viable.  To the extent the summary of facts and finding of facts actually represent conclusions of law, they should be so considered and visa versa.
