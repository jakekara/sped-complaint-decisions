Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  1. Whether the Board offered an appropriate program for the Student for the 2005-
2006 school year.  2. If not, whether the program and placement at Franklin Academy is an appropriate 
program to meet the Student&#8482;s educational needs for the 2005-2006 school year. 
 3. Whether the Board is financially responsible for the program and placement for 
the Student for the 2005-2006 school year.  SUMMARY:   This 17 year old Student began to attend the Board schools in October 2003, at 
which time he was eligible for special education and related services as other health 
impaired &#338; ADD/ADHD.  The Student attended only 16 days of school from October 
through the end of 2003, at which time the Parent unilaterally placed the Student at a 
private therapeutic school for the remainder of the school year.  After an unsuccessful 
placement at that school, the Parent placed the Student at another private school for the 

2004-2005 school year.  In April 2005, the Student was dismissed from the private school 
due to his failure to meet the attendance polic
y, inability to sustain the effort to handle the 
curriculum and failure to meet the academic standard.  The Board provided homebound 
tutoring for the remainder of that school year.
