stated that even if these violations were true, they were a violation of the Family 
Education Rights of Privacy Act (&#64257;FERPA&#64258;), not the student&#8482;s educational program; 
therefore, the hearing officer lacked jurisdiction to hear this complaint.  A hearing date

hearing officer did not have jurisdiction over purely FERPA issues.  Therefore, for
