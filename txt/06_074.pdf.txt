  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  PROCEDURAL HISTORY   This hearing request was received at the State Department of Education (SDE) on March 
10, 2006.  This hearing officer was assigned to the case on March 13.  The Connecticut Technical High School System (&#64257;CTHSS&#64258;) recei
ved the request for hearing on March 15, 2006.  
Counsel appeared for CTHSS on March 21.  On that date a copy of the CTHSS response to the complaint was sent by Ms. Jill M. Dymczyk, 
Special Education Consultant, CTHSS.  A prehearing conference was held on March 23, 2006 with the Mother.  The attorney for CTHSS could not be reached and two messages were left 
with her office.  A hearing date was scheduled for April 26 and the decision deadline was set at May 25, 2006.  The decision deadline was set based on the receipt date by the SDE.  The decision deadline was amended to May 30, 2006, 
which reflects the receipt date by the CTHSS.  Following the conference, Ms. Dymczyk 
contacted the Hearing Officer and stated that she had been waiting for the prehearing conference telephone call.  She was advised that once an attorney appears for a party, the attorney would be the contact person.  On March 24, the CTHSS attorney wrote a letter explaining the mix-up and 
asked to add an issue to the hearing.  The parties were directed to file witness lists and exhibits by April 19.  The Parents did not file any. The CTHSS filed Exhibits B-1 through B-13 and a witness list.   The hearing convened on April 26, 2006.  The Mother presented her case.  She offered no exhibits and stated that she would be the only witness.  The hearing request was marked as 
Hearing Officer Exhibit 1 (HO-1).  The March 24 letter from the CTHSS attorney was marked as 
HO-2.  The first matter heard was objections to e
xhibits.  The Mother did not bring her copy of the CTHSS exhibit book to the hearing.  After being given an opportunity to review the CTHSS exhibits, she did not object to any.  The CTHSS Exhibits were entered as full exhibits.  The
