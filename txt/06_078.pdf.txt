 STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION  Student v. Fairfield Board of Education  Appearing on Behalf of the Student:  Pro Se 
 Appearing on Behalf of the Board:  Michelle C. Laubin, Esq. 
      Berchem, Moses & Devlin, P.C. 
      75 Broad Street 
      Milford, CT  06460 
 Appearing Before:    Attorney Justino Rosado, Hearing Officer 
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  1. Did the Board&#8482;s program for the 2005-2006 school year provide the Student with 
a free, appropriate, public education (FAPE) as required in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401 et seq? 
2. If not, should the Board be required to pay for the proposed services of the 

Disability Resource Network? 3. Should the Student be required to graduate with the Class of 2006? 
4. Is the Student entitled to compensatory education? 
 SUMMARY:  The Student is a 19 year old young man who has been identified as Learning Disabled 

and is eligible to receive special education and related services as stated in the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401 et seq. and Connecticut 
General Statute Sec. 10-76a.  The Student objected to the 2005-2006 IEP proposed by the 
Board and requested that he be placed at Disability Resource Network at the Board&#8482;s 
expense.  The Board denied the Student&#8482;s request.  On or about March 16, 2006, the Board received notice of the Student&#8482;s request for due 
process.  A pre-hearing conference was held on or about March 31, 2006.  Hearing dates 

of April 24 and April 27, 2006 were chosen by the parties.  Instead of a resolution 
meeting the parties decided to have a formal mediation.  The parties were able to resolve 

their issue and the Student requested the matter be dismissed with prejudice.  The Final 

Decision and Order date was extended to June 10, 2006 in order to accommodate the 

parties&#8482; mediation. 
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The due process hearing is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
