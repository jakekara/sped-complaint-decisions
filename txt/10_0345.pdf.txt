conference and perhaps mediation, but 
no dates had been set.  Hearing dates were agreed on for April 14, 2010 and April 26, 2010.  The mailing date for the fina
l decision was set at May 17, 2010.  On April 5, 
2010, the Parents&#8482; attorney filed a joint request for a 30-day postponement of the hearing dates and 
extension of the mailing date for the final decision

discussions following an informal resolution se
ssion.  The request was granted, the hearing was rescheduled for May 26, 2010 and the mailing date for th
e final decision was extended to June 19, 2010. 
On May 20, 2010, the Parents&#8482; attorney advised the He
aring Officer that the ma
tter was settled and an agreement had been signed.  She stated that the hear
ing request was being withdr
awn with prejudice.  On
