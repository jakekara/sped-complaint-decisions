 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  PROCEDURAL HISTORY   The Parents' attorney filed a request for an expedited due process hearing on February 10, 
2006.  On February 14, this Hearing Officer was assigned to the case.  The Board 
received the hearing request on February 15, 2006. A prehearing conference was held on February 21, 2006. The Parents' attorney requested that hearings be conducted in the 

afternoon to accommodate the Student's disability.  The Board's attorney objected to four 

partial day hearings.  The Parents' attorney also requested time to discuss a possible 

settlement with the Board.  The Hearing Officer advised him that since this was an 

expedited hearing, the hearing must be completed within 20 school days of the hearing 

request and a decision rendered within 10 school days thereafter.  The parties were free to 
discuss settlement within those parameters.  Hearing dates were agreed on for March 6 

for the afternoon, March 8 for a full day and March 13 for the afternoon.  The decision 
deadline was set at March 30, 2006.  Witness lists and exhibits were due on February 27.  

On February 27, the Parents' attorney faxed 
a request for dismissal without prejudice to 
the Hearing Officer for the reason that the parties were attempting to resolve the dispute 

over the Student's Manifestation Determination PPT meeting and the expulsion that led to 

the hearing request.  On March 2, the Hearing Officer wrote a letter to the parties 
advising them that a decision would be issued
 granting the request and that the hearings for March 6, 8 and 13 were canceled.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  It is ordered that this case be dismissed without prejudice.
