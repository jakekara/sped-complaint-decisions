FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Multiple Disabilities and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut
General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the
program offered by the Board for the 2010-201 1 school year. The Parents requested placement at the Center
for Growth and Development. The Board refused the Parents’ request and the Parents ﬁled for due process.
On January 13, 2012, the Board received notice of the Parents request for due process. The palties agreed to
go to mediation in place of a resolution meeting.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on January 13, 2012 and a pre—hearing conference was held on
January 19, 2012. Hearing dates of June 18, 19 and 21, 2012 were chosen by the parties.

In an electronic transmission, the Parent’s attorney advised the hearing officer that the palties were able to
resolve the matter in mediation and that the matter would be withdrawn with prejudice once the parties had
formalized the agreement. On or about April 4, 2012, in an electronic transmission the parties informed the
hearing ofﬁcer that the agreement was not ratiﬁed and the hearing would be going forward. On J une 12,
2012, the palties informed the hearing officer that the matter was resolved and the request for due process

was withdrawn with prejudice.

The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the parties’
mediation and the hearing date. The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order is June 27, 2012,

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
