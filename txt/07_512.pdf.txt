PROCEDURAL HISTORY: 

 The Parents' attorney requested this h
earing on May 19, 2008, by faxing a letter to the State Department of Education ("SDE"). 
 The Board received a copy of the letter on May 20, 2008.  The Board&#8482;s attorney filed an appearance on that date.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on May 20, 2008.  On June 3, 2008, a prehearing conference was held.  The mailing date for 
the final decision was set at August 4.  
Hearing dates were agreed on for July 22 and 24, 2008.  On July 14, 2008, the Parents&#8482; 
attorney requested a postponement of both hear
ing dates because the parties needed time 
to gather information necessary to complete 
settlement discussions begun in mediation on 
July 1, 2008.  The request was granted, the hearing was postponed to August 20, 2008.
