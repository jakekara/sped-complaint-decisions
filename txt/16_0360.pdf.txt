FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Was the program offered by the Board for the 2015—2016 school year appropriate and
does it provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the
least restrictive environment (LRE)?

2. Does the Student require a one to one monitor on ﬁeld trips in order to receive
FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Speciﬁc Learning Disability and is entitled to receive FAPE
as deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C.
§1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement
team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2015-2016
school year. The Parents requested safety support in the Student’s 2015-2016 IEP program. The
Board refused the Parents’ request.

On February 24, 2016, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. An
impaltial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on F ebmary 23, 2016 and a pre—hearing conference was
held on February 29, 2016. The parties agreed to go to a mediation meeting in lieu of a
resolution meeting.

In an electronic transmission, the Parents advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties were able to
resolve the issues and requested that the matter be withdrawn. There was no objection by the

Board. The withdrawal was granted. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is May
9, 2016.

F INAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED.

 

If the local 01' regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
