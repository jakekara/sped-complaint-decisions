  The Parents faxed a request for hearing to the State Department of Education 
("SDE") on July 2, 2008.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on July 7, 2008.  
The Board received a copy of the hearing reque

filed an appearance on July 11, 2008.  On July 16, 2008, the Parents filed an amended 

due process request adding an additional claim.  A prehearing conference was held on 
July 17, 2008, with the Parents and the Board&#8482;s attorney.  The Board offered to mediate

nts filed an additional exhibit.  On August 

25, 2008, the Parents faxed the Hearing Officer a letter stating that they had rejected the
