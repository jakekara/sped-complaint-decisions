Appearing before: Justino Rosado, Esq., Hearing Ofﬁcer

F INAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Is the program provided by the Board for the 2014-2015 school year appropriate and does it provide
the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment
(LRE)?

2. Should the Student be returned to the school program that was being provided prior to May 27,
2014 PPT?

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as Other Health Impaired and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in
the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §l401 et seq. and
Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the
Parent was in disagreement with the program offered by the Board for the 2014—2015 school year; the
Parent requested the Student’s prior program. The Board refused the Parent’s request. On September
12, 2014, the Board received notice of the Student’s request for due process. The parties agreed to go to
a resolution meeting. An impartial hearing officer was appointed on June 18, 2014 and a pre—hearing
conference was held on September 17, 2014. A hearing date October 24, 2014 was chosen by the
parties. At the pre—hearing conference, the Parent requested that the Student remain at his prior
placement. An order of stay-put was issued on September 18, 2014.

On September 15, 2014, the Board ﬁled a sufﬁciency challenge on this matter. The Parent was advised
at the pre-hearing conference that she needed to respond to the sufﬁciency challenge. On October 3,
2014, the Parent was sent notice that the matter would be dismissed if she did not respond to the Board’s
sufﬁciency challenge or if the matter was settled she needed to advise the hearing ofﬁcer. The Board
notiﬁed the hearing ofﬁcer that the Parent, at a PPT meeting, made reference to withdrawing the matter.
Since the Parent did not respond to the hearing ofﬁcer’s request, on October 8, 2014, the Parent was sent
notice that the matter would be dismissed. There has been no response from the Parent. The date for the
ﬁling of the Final Decision and Order is November 26, 2014.

F INAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

 

Ifthe local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the

ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance With the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
