Hearing Officer    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUE:  Whether the Student is entitled to counseling by a private psychologist for at least one 
session per week as part of his program for special education and related services. 
 SUMMARY:   The Mother brought this request for due process, and this matter was assigned on 

March 18.  A prehearing conference was held on March 23.  At the prehearing conference, the Mother stated that the Father shared educational decision-making with 
her. She requested that the Father be included in the hearing.  The Mother&#8482;s written 
request for a due process hearing indicated the different addresses for the Mother and the Father, although the request for hearing was signed solely by the Mother.  Hearing dates of April 13 and April 26 were scheduled, and a notice of these scheduled hearing dates 
was sent to the Mother, the Father and the Board&#8482;s attorney.  On April 6, the Mother submitted a notice via facsimile which indicated that she 
did not want to proceed with the hearing.  The facsimile submitted did not indicate 
whether the Father agreed with the Mother&#8482;s decision, or whether the Father was notified of this decision.  Furthermore, the facsimile did not include any notice that the Board had 

been notified regarding the Mother&#8482;s decision not to proceed with this hearing.
