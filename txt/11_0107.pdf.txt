FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY: 
By letter dated August 24, 2010, Student&#8482;s Parent requested the Board&#8482;s Director of Pupil Services &#64257;to move to the next level of due process&#64258;. On 
September 2, 2010, the Board&#8482;s Representative forwarded Parent&#8482;s letter to the Due Process Unit, Connecticut State Department of Education.  On September 10, 
2010, an Education Consultant at the Due Process Unit wrote to Parent, requesting clarification of his request. This Hearing Officer was appointed
 on September 17, 2010.  On September 23, 2010, this 
Hearing Officer sent out a notice for a pre-hearing conference.  By email dated October 5, 2010, 
Parent&#8482;s Attorney notified the Hearing Officer and the Board&#8482;s Attorney that 
she would be representing Parent. The pre-hearing conference was held on October 7, 2010.  The Board had challenged the sufficiency of the Parent&#8482;s request for a hearing, and during the pre-hearing conference the Hearing Officer agreed, and ruled the request insufficient. Pare
nt&#8482;s Attorney agreed to draft a revised request for hearing, and the Hearing Officer stated that she would draft issues from
 that letter.  These facts were memorialized in a 
memorandum written by the Hearing Officer and emailed to the Parties on October 7, 2010.  The 
hearing was scheduled for November 18, 2010, and 
the Parties discussed requesting mediation. 
When the Parties and the Due Process Unit notified th
e Hearing Officer that mediation would be held on 
November 18, 2010, the Hearing Officer granted the requ
est of the Parties that the hearing be postponed from that date. 
  The Hearing Officer has received no revised request for hearing, and therefore is not aware of any case or controversy between the Parties.
