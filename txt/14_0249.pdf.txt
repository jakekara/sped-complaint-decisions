FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Was the decision by the New Britain Board of Education (“Board”) to deny the
Parents’ request for an Independent Educational Evaluation (“TEE”) for a psychological;
speech and language; occupational therapy; and a functional behavioral analysis,
appropriate?

2. If not, are the Parents entitled to a publicly funded IEE for a psychological, speech and
language, occupational therapy, and a functional behavioral analysis?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This matter was ﬁled by the New Britain Board of Education (“Board”) on October 30,
2013. A preheating conference was held on December 6, 2014, after the Parents obtained
legal counsel. The Parents requested that the resolution period be extended for settlement
purposes, to which the Board did not object. The initial due process hearing was set for
February 3, 2014, with a final decision and order date of February 12, 2014. The Patties
agreed to utilize mediation in an attempt to settle the matter. A mediation date of January
30, 2014 was set, which necessitated rescheduling the due process hearing date to
Febnlary 20, 2014 and an extension of the date for the ﬁnal decision and order to March
14, 2014. On January 27, 2014, counsel for the Board withdrew the complaint, as the
Parties had reached agreement in principle.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

This matter has been withdrawn by the Board, citing agreement in principle by the
Parties. With no further issues to be considered, this matter is DISMISSED.
