FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
A special education hearing in the above-captioned matter 
was requested by Student via Letter dated July 28, 
2010.
1 It was received by the Board of Education on July 28.
 The thirty-day resolution period ran through August 27 
and the original deadline for mailing the final decision and order was October 11, 2010. 
On August 13, Student&#8482;s Attorney filed a request to ex
tend the mailing date in order to permit the parties to 
participate in mediation prior to beginning hearings. After 
fully considering the positions of the parties, the request 
was granted and the deadline to mail the final 
decision and order was ex
tended until November 10. 
A hearing was scheduled for October 14. On August 30, th
e Board of Education&#8482;s Attorney indicated that her 
client was scheduled to be out of stat
e on that date and requested that the hearing be rescheduled. The first mutually 
available date was October 21. The Hearing Officer indicated
 to the parties that the hearing could be scheduled for October 21 only if there was an extension of the mailing date. 
On September 1, Student&#8482;s Attorney filed a request to 
extend the mailing date in order to permit the parties to 
participate in mediation prior to beginning hearings and due to the difficulty of finding mutually agreeable hearing 
dates. After fully considering the positions of the parti
es, the request was granted and the mailing date was extended 
to December 10, 2010. The hearing was scheduled for October 21. 
On September 27, Student&#8482;s Attorney indicated that th
e parties reached agreement 
at mediation on September 
21 and that the claim would be withdrawn with prejudi
ce once a written agreement had been executed. On October 
18, Student&#8482;s Attorney withdrew the case with prejudice. 
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
In light of the above facts, the above-captioned case is hereby dismissed with prejudice.
