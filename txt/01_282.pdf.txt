  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUES:    1. Whether the Student&#8482;s IEP and educational placement for the 2001-2002 school 
year provides the Student a free and appropriate public education sufficient to meet 
his special needs.  2. Whether the Student should be placed in a regular education class full day with 
supplementary aides and services.  (Inherent in the review of this issue is whether 

the Board has violated the IDEA by failing to consider full day placement of the 
Student in regular education)  3. Whether placement at Pomperaug Elementary School or Long Meadow Elementary 
School is most appropriate?  (noting neither of these schools is the Student&#8482;s home 
school)  PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  The Parents requested a hearing on August 29, 2001.  During the Prehearing Conference held on September 11, 2001 the first day of hearing was scheduled for
