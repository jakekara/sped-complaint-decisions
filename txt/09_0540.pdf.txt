ers, J.D., M.A. (Clinical Psychology) Hearing Officer  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  This matter was commenced by request for due pr
ocess dated June 19, 2009 (the &#64257;Request&#64258;).  The 
undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer on July 
10, 2009, after 
the hearing officer to whom the case 
was initially assigned had recused 
herself.  By notice dated July 17, 2009 issued by the Connecticut 
Department of Education (&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;) Due Process Unit,
 a CTDOE-facilitated mediation was scheduled for 
July 20, 2009.  By a second notice issued on July 17, 2009, 
the date of that mediation was changed to July 
24, 2009.  On July 28, 2009 in response to an inquiry from
 the Hearing Officer direct
ed to the parties for a 
report of the status of this matter, the Hearing Officer
 was advised by counsel for the Student that the parties had reached an agreement resolving their dispute at
 the CTDOE-facilitated mediation.  That information 
was subsequently confirmed by a further transm
ittal from counsel for the Student on July 30, 2009 
withdrawing the request for due process with prejudice as a settlement had been reached.   
 This matter is hereby DISMISSED.
