  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  This matter had been scheduled for hearing May 9, May 19, May 31, June 7, June 17, 

June 20 and June 22, 2005. Requests for continuances were made for various reasons and 
these were granted for May 9, May 19, June 17 and June 20.  At the hearing of June 7, 2005 the parties reported that they had reached an agreement in principle and requested 
time to reduce it to writing.  On June 13, 2005 the parent requested a continuance of the 
June 17 and June 20 dates of hearing as they had not yet received the written agreement 

from the Board and would need time to review it with the Parent.  The date for mailing of 
the final decision was June 23, 2005 and the matter was continued to June 22, 2005 to 
give an additional couple of days to allow the matter to be resolved.  At the Hearing of 
June 22, 2005 the Board secretary reported that the matter had in fact been settled.  The 
matter was dismissed on the record. 
   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The matter is 
DISMISSED.
