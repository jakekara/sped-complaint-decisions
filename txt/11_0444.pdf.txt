SUMMARY

Parents asked for reimbursement of their unilateral placement of the Student in a private
school, arguing that the Board had not adequately addressed Student’s special education

needs.

Parents requested an order that their expert be allowed to obsewe the program in which
the Board proposed placement for the Student. The Board opposed such observation,
because the Student was not currently enrolled in that program. The Hearing Ofﬁcer
denied Parents’ Motion on June 3, 201 1.

This dispute having been settled and the Parents having withdrawn their request for
hearing with prejudice, this matter is DISMISSED with prejudice.
