Appearing before:   
Attorney Mary
 Elizabeth Oppenheim, Hearing Officer FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
ISSUES: 1.Whether the Board&#8482;s failure to propose a program for the Student for the 2010-11 school year by the date of the filing of the request for hearing [March 25, 2010] is appropriate. 2.Whether the Parents are entitled to reimburse
ment for their proposed placement of the 
Student at Eagle Hill School in Southport for the 2010-11 school year.   PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND: The Board received this request for hear
ing [Exhibit H.O.-1] on March 25 and a 
prehearing conference was convened on April 8, 2010. Prior to the prehearing conference, the Board filed a Motion to Dismiss on the basis that 
the claim of denial of a free appropriate public
 education [FAPE] for the Student for the 2010-11 school year was not ripe for adjudication and should be dismissed.  The Parents&#8482; attorney 

submitted a Memorandum in Opposition to the Moti
on to Dismiss with exhibits on April 12. 
It was undisputed that the Board had not, as
 of the filing of the request for hearing, 
proposed a program for the Student for the 2010-11 school year.  Without such a filing, it would 

be premature for the Parents to challenge the ap
propriateness of a program that has not yet been proposed by the Board. In the request for hear
ing, during the prehearing conference and in the Parents&#8482; Memorandum in Opposition and the accomp
anying exhibits, the Parents asserted that 
their challenge was a procedural claim, not a claim challenging a proposed program.  The alleged 
violations included the Parents&#8482; claim that the Board failed to
 convene a PPT meeting at the 
Parents&#8482; request[s] and the alleged delay in proposing an IEP for the Student for the 2010-11 

school year as of the time of th
e filing of this request for hearing.  The Motion to Dismiss was
