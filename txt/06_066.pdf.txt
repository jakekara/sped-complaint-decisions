appropriate to Student&#8482;s special education needs in the least restrictive environment? 
 If not, is placement at Aspen Ranch appropria
te to Student&#8482;s special education needs?  Is the Board responsible for funding Student&#8482;s placement at Aspen Ranch? 
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  This hearing was requested on March 6, 2006.  After a prior hearing officer had held a 
pre-hearing conference, scheduled several hearing sessions, and postponed the first one (April 6, 2006), she recused herself and this hearing officer was appointed on April 19, 2006.  When the hearing was about to convene on April 25, 2006, the parties asked for 

some time to attempt a settlement, and after three hours, settlement was reached.  On the 

record, the parties reported that settlement had been reached and that the Parents&#8482; request 

for hearing was being withdrawn.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The request for hearing having been withdrawn and the dispute having been settled, this 

matter is DISMISSED.
