Kearns &#8226;Hearing Officer &#8226;FINAL DECISION AND ORDER ISSUES: 1. Parent requests one-to-one aide be assigned to the child. PROCEDURAL HISTORY: The parent requested hearing on March 25, 2001. The prehearing conference convened on April 2, 2002 and again on April 9, 2002. Hearings convened on April 22, 29, May 14, June 4, 5, 11, and 18. The parent requested postponement of the hearings that convened on April 22, 29, and June 4, 2002. Counsel for the district requested postponement of the hearing, which convened on May 14, 2002. The request was made because counsel was leaving her position at the Corporate Counsel&#8482;s Office and new counsel needed time to become familiar with the case. The parent objected to the District&#8482;s request for postponement. After testimony and argument the District&#8482;s request was granted. On June 18, 2001, the parties agreed that transcripts would be ordered. Both parties agreed on the record that the decision could be delayed if the transcripts arrived during the Hearing Officer&#8482;s scheduled vacation. The record closed September 3, 2002. SUMMARY: The student, an eight-year-old, was suspended six times in a four-month period. The parent requested a one-to-one aide to help the student with academic and behavior issues.
