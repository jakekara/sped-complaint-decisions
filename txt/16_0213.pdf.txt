FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Was the program provided by the Board for the 2014-2015 school year appropriate and did it
provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE)?

2, Is the program provided by the Board for the 2015—2016 school year appropriate and does it provide
the Student with FAPE in the LRE?

3. Does the Student require extended day and extended school year services for the 2015-2016 school
year in order to receive FAPE in the LRE?

4. Does the Student require an out of district placement in order to receive FAPE in the LRE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Dyslexia and is entitled to receive FAPE in the LRE as deﬁned in
the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General
Statutes §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the
program offered by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year and requested an out of district placement,
an extended school day and an extended school year, all at public expense. The Board refused the
Parents’ request and the Parents ﬁled for due process.

The Board received notice of the request for due process on October 21, 2015. An impartial hearing
ofﬁcer was appointed on October 21, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was held on October 30, 2015.
The parties attended a resolution session on October 29, 2015. In an electronic transmission, the Parents’
attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that they were withdrawing the matter without prejudice. There was
no objection from the Board. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is January 4, 2016.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing officer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
