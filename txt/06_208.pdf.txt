 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
(October 16, 2006)  SUMMARY   By letter dated July 7, 2006 to the Department of Education&#8482;s (&#64257;DOE&#8482;s&#64258;) Due 
Process Unit, the Board requested a due process hearing.  As set forth more fully in the 
notices and scheduling orders issued in this 
matter and filings made by the parties in this 
matter, there is no dispute that, at all pertinen
t times, the Student was eligible to receive 
&#64257;special education&#64258; and &#64257;related services&#64258; pu
rsuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1400 
et seq. (the &#64257;IDEA&#64258;), as amended effective July 1, 
2005 by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (the 

&#64257;IDEIA&#64258;), as well as under Connecticut&#8482;s special education laws, Conn. Gen. Stat. &#167;&#167; 10-76, et seq.   There is no dispute that the District was providing special education and related services to the Student at all pertinent times dur
ing the 2005/2006 school year and that the Student&#8482;s behavioral presentation had changed over the course of that year.  
 The District claimed that the parties had 
agreed that the Student would be given a 
psychiatric evaluation.  The Dist
rict sought the evaluation to clarify the causes of changes in the Student&#8482;s presentation at school over the course of the 2005/2006 school year.  The 

District sought to have the evaluation performed by an evalua
tor selected by the District, 
Michael Kaplan, MD.  The District sought an order compelling the Parents to allow the 
Student to be evaluated by Dr. Kaplan.  In their response dated July 19, 2006, the Parents claimed that they had agreed to a psychi
atric evaluation but did not agree that the evaluation would be performed by Dr. Kaplan and, given the disagreement with the 

District over who would perform the evalua
tion, they subsequently arranged for a psychiatric evaluation of the Student by Gordon Weiss, MD.  They claimed further that 
Dr. Weiss&#8482; evaluation would be complete
d on or about July 28, 2006 and that the
