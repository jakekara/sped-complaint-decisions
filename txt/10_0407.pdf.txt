requested permission to withdraw their Request that the Hearing be expedited and to allow the matter to 

proceed as a standard Request for Due Process. On May 12, 2010, the Hearing Officer granted the 
Parents request which rendered the Board&#8482;s Motion to Dismiss moot. On May 17, 2010, the Prehearing

On May 17, 2010, the Parents notified the Hearing Officer that the parties settled the matter and 
withdrew their Request for Hearing with prejudice. FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: The matter is
