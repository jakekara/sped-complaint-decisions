SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Speciﬁc Learning Disability and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in
the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General
Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program
offered by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year and requested placement at the Prospect Program at
Wooster School for the 2015-2016 school year.

The Board refused the Parents’ request. On J anuary 20, 2016, the Board received notice of the Parents’ due
process request. An impaitial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on January 13, 2016 and a pre-hearing conference
was held on January 27, 2016 at which a hearing date of March 29, 2016 was scheduled. At the March 29,
2016 hearing, the Parents’ attorney informed the hearing ofﬁcer that the matter had been resolved but needed
to be memorialized. The Parents’ attorney withdrew the matter without prejudice; the Board was in accord
with the withdrawal. The mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is April 4, 2016.
