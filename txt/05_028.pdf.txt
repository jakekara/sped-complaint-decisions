Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER ISSUE:  Whether the evaluation of the Student can proceed with the Mother&#8482;s consent and despite 
the Father&#8482;s objection to the testing.  SUMMARY:  This hearing request was filed by the Father.  The matter was assigned on 
February 3, and a prehearing conference was held on February 8.  An extension of the mailing date of the decision, filed by the Board, was granted in accordance with Section 
10-76h-9(e) of the Connecticut Regulations which provides for a 30 day postponement 

for settlement discussions between the parties, and the hearing was scheduled for April 7.  
The Parents, who are divorced, were both given notice of this hearing date.  Attorney Nora Belanger, an attorney for the Mother sent a copy of a correspondence addressed to Attorney Matthew Newman, to the undersigned hearing 

officer, on February 15, directing Attorney Newman to forward information to her 
regarding this pending case.   Attorney Belanger did not file an appearance in this case.  In a correspondence dated February 24, postmarked February 28, and received on 
March 1, the Father noted that he was no longer objecting to the testing recommended at 
the PPT, and requested that the hearing of April 7 be cancelled.    As the Father&#8482;s objection to the testing was the sole issue for this hearing, this case is dismissed. 
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The matter is 
DISMISSED.
