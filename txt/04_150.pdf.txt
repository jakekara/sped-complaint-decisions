 August 19, 2004 - 1 - Final Decision and Order 04-150   STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION   Student v. Shelton Board of Education     On behalf of the Parents: Attorney David C. Shaw Law Offices of David C. Shaw, LLC 34 Jerome Avenue, Suite 210 Bloomfield, CT  06002-2463   On behalf of the Board: Attorney Christine L. Chinni Shipman & Goodwin LLP One Constitution Plaza Hartford, CT  06103-1919   Before Hearing Officer: Scott P. Myers, J.D., M.A. (Clinical Psychology)  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  SUMMARY   This matter was commenced by the Parents by request dated June 4, 2004 (a Friday).  The Parents challenged a decision made at a PPT convened on May 28, 2004 regarding the criteria for exiting the Student from eligibility for special education and related services, and challenged the adequacy of transition planning for the Student particularly in the 2003/2004 academic year.  The Parents asked that the hearing officer assigned to this matter immediately enter a stay put order in light of the Board&#8482;s alleged intention to terminate all services to the Student effective June 7, 2004 (the following Monday).  Upon review of the June 4, 2004 letter, the Hearing Officer immediately attempted to arrange a telephone conference to address the need for emergency stay put relief, but was advised by counsel for the Parents that there was no longer a need for entry of such an order.    By letter dated June 15, 2004, the Parents requested that the Hearing Officer recuse himself.  The Board objected to the motion, which was denied by order dated June 17, 2004.  That motion appears to have been based on a mistaken assumption regarding how this matter was assigned to this Hearing Officer.                 A pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) was convened on June 17.   Each party attended through counsel.  Three hearing dates were identified (June 29, July 12 and July 13) and a schedule for the exchange of witness list and exhibits was entered.  In accordance with the June 17 scheduling order, the parties submitted their records and witness lists.  All three of the scheduled hearing dates were ultimately cancelled.  This matter was reported settled on August 3 and is dismissed with prejudice except to the extent that the settlement agreement between the parties provides otherwise.
