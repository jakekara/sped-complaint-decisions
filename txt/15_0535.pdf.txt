as deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C.
§l401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statutes §10-76a et seq. The Parent rejected the program

placement at White Oaks Academy in Massachusetts. The Board refused the Parent’s request.
The Board ﬁled a timely Motion to Dismiss challenging the jurisdiction of the hearing ofﬁcer
and/or that the matter was res judicata. The Motion to Dismiss was Granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT:

1. The Student is diagnosed with Speciﬁc Learning Disability and eligible to receive special
education and related services as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Improvement Act (“IDEA”) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statutes
§10-76a. (B-3).

2. At the April 2, 2013 planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the team
recommended a diagnostic placement at the Intensive Education Academy (TEA). The
Parent agreed to explore IEA but the Student was never placed. (B—3, Testimony of
Director of Pupil Services (DPS))

10.

The Parent placed the Student at White Oaks Academy in Massachusetts as a privately
funded unilateral placement. White Oaks Academy does not have diagnostic placements
for private placements. There was no PPT meeting to place the Student at White Oaks
Academy or a review of his individualized educational program with White Oaks
personnel. (Testimony of White Oaks Academy Headmaster)

The placement at White Oaks Academy was not approved by the PPT. The Student is
currently attending the Board’s school. (Testimony of Director of Pupil Sewices)

On April 2, 2013, the Parent gave notice of her intended placement of the Student at
White Oaks Academy. On May 3, 2013, the Parent informed the district that she had
placed the Student at White Oaks Academy. (P-No. 1, Testimony of Parent, P—No. 3)

The student was enrolled in White Oaks Academy on May 2, 2013, as a day placement,
and remained a Student there for thirty—six school days. The Student’s last day of school
was June 24, 2013. The Headmaster did not regard the placement as a diagnostic
placement. (Hearing Ofﬁcer Exhibit3 No. 2, Testimony of White Oaks Academy
Headmaster)

There was a PPT meeting scheduled for June 21, 2013. The PPT was not held because
the Board and Parent’s attorney decided to confer in an attempt to resolve the issues
between the paities. (Testimony of Director of Pupil Services, P—No 4)

The Parent had previously ﬁled a request for due process, Student v. Somers Board of
Education Case No. 14-0358. She was seeking reimbursement for a unilateral diagnostic
placement at White Oaks Academy. (Testimony of Director of Pupil Services, 13-2)

The hearing ofﬁcer in the prior request for due process, Supra, granted the Board’s
request to dismiss the hearing. The dismissa1 was without prejudice. (B-3)

On July 7, 2015, the Somers Board of Education ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss. The motion
requested dismissal for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and
challenged the hearing ofﬁcer’s subject matter jurisdiction. (H.O.-4)

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW and ARGUMENT:

1.

It is undisputed that the Student is eligible for special education and related services as
set forth in IDEA, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401, et seq. FAPE is deﬁned as special education and
related selvices that are provided at public expense, meet the standards of the state
educational agency, include an appropriate school education, and that are provided in
conformity with the IEP. 20 U.S.C. §1401(8).

Once a Board has identiﬁed a child as eligible for IDEA services, it must create and
implement an IEP based on the student's needs and areas of disability. Boards are not,

October 30, 2015 F inal Decision and Order Case No. 15-0535

however, required to “maximize the potential” of each handicapped student. Bd, ofEduc.
OfHendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 197 n. 21 (1982)).
Instead, to satisfy the IDEA, the Board must offer an IEP that is “reasonably calculated”
to enable the child to receive “meaningful” educational beneﬁts in light of the student‘s
intellectual potential. @at 206-207. Once the Board has designed and administered an
IEP that is reasonably calculated to enable the receipt of meaningful educational beneﬁts,
it has satisﬁed its obligation to provide the child with FAPE.

3. If the Parent or the Student is not satisﬁed that the program will not provide FAPE, they
can challenge the educational placement. 34 C.F.R. §300.507(a)(l). It is the Board’s
responsibility of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the appropriateness of the
program and placement it has provided to the Student. Conn. Gen. Stat. (CGS) §10—76h—
14(a).

4. On May 26, 2013, the Parent challenged the educational placement of the Student, and
the Board ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss the matter for failure to state a claim on which relief
can be granted and challenged the hearing ofﬁcer’s subject matter jurisdiction. A motion
to dismiss tests not whether the plaintiff will prevail on the merits, but instead whether
the plaintiff has properly stated a claim. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974).
Thus, the couit may dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim only if it is clear that
no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the
allegations. See Hishan v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984); Alchinsan v. District
ofColumbia, 73 F.3d 418, 422 (DC. Cir. 1996). In deciding such a motion, the court
must accept all of the complaint‘s well-pled factual allegations as true and draw all
reasonable inferences in the non-movant's favor. See Scheuer, 416 U.S. at 236. The court
need not accept legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations. Lowal v4 MCI
Communications Corp, 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (DC. Cir. 1994).

5. The Board alleges that the Parent’s claim for due process should be dismissed because
the same issues had been presented before in Student v. Somers Board ofEducation, Case
No. 14—0358, and the Hearing Ofﬁcer had dismissed the matter without prejudice making
the current case before this hearing ofﬁcer res judicata. (Findings of Fact No. 8 and 9)

6. The Hearing Ofﬁcer’s Decision and Order, in Supra, “Dismissed the complaint Without
prejudice as the Board’s Motion to Dismiss had been granted.” (B-3) In the Motion to
Dismiss in the prior due process complaint, Supra, the issue was reimbursement for the
unilateral diagnostic placement by the Parent at White Oaks Academy. The issue in the
current matter is the appropriateness of the 2012-2013 program and reimbursement for
the unilateral placement at White Oaks Academy. The Parent has clariﬁed in this matter
that the placement is a unilateral placement. The Headmaster testiﬁed that the Student’s
placement was a unilateral placement and White Oaks Academy does not have diagnostic
placements for private placements. The Headmaster did not regard the Student’s
placement as a diagnostic placement. (Findings of Fact No. 3) Therefore, the Parent’s
request for due process is not res judicata.

7. The Board also claims that the issues presented in this matter are beyond the Statute of
Limitations and should be dismissed. Connecticut General Statute Sec. 10-76h—4(a)
states; “A party shall have two years to request a hearing from the time the public agency
proposed or refused to initiate 01' change the identiﬁcation, evaluation or educational
placement of, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to the child. If
notice of the procedural safeguards, including notice of the limitations contained in this
section, is not given, such tWO-year limitation shall be calculated from the time notice of
the safeguards is properly given.”

8. The Parent gave notice of her intent of a unilateral placement at the April 2, 2013 PPT.
The Student was unilaterally placed on June 2, 2013. The Parent in her complaint states
that there was a PPT meeting held on J une 21, 2013 where the unilateral placement was
discussed. The PPT had been scheduled but did not go forward as the parties’ attorneys
decided to try and resolve the issues. (F indings Of F act No. 7) The resolution meeting
held on June 21, 2013 does meet the requirement of the time when the procedural
“safeguards is properly given.” The Parent now alleges that she was not given procedural
safeguards. The Parent at the time of the 2012-2013 school year was represented by
competent counsel (P-5) and in her prior due process request, Student v. Somers Board of
Education, Case No. 14-0358, does not allege a procedural violation stating that she was
not provided with procedural safeguards. The due process request in this current matter
was not timely ﬁled and does not comply with the Statute of Limitations as deﬁned in
Connecticut General Statute Sec. 10-76h—4(a). The request for hearing was received by
the Board on May 26, 2015. In order to comply with Connecticut General Statute
Sec.10—76h-4, the request for due process should have been ﬁled by April 2, 2015, two
years from the PPT where the parent raised the issue. Therefore, the Board’s Motion to
Dismiss is granted because the due process request Was not timely ﬁled and is not within
the Statute of Limitations.

9. To the extent a procedural claim raised by the Parent is not speciﬁcally addressed herein,
the Hearing Ofﬁcer has concluded that the claim lacked merit.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

Issues No. l, 2, and 3 are dismissed with prejudice because they are not within the scope of the
two year Statute of Limitations as deﬁned in Connecticut General Statute Sec. 10—76h—4(a).

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requhing special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescﬁption of the healing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days aﬁer
receipt thereqf, the State Board of Education shall take appropm'ate action to enforce the

ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing officer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(1)(2)(A).
