  This hearing was requested on March 5, 2008, and the hearing officer was appointed on March 7, 2008.  A pre-hearing conference by conference telephone call was scheduled for April 8, 2008: Ms. Bonnington appeared for Parent but Attorney McKeon did not appear, due to scheduling confusion.

  The request for dismissal is GRANTED: this
 case is dismissed without prejudice.
