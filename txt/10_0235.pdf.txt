: The Student has been identified with Autism and is en
titled to receive FAPE as defined in IDEIA, 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. At a PPT meeting the Parents were not in 

agreement with the program being provided to the 
Student and requested placement at the Watkinson 
School in Hartford, Connecticut. The Board denied the parent&#8482;s request and the Parent filed for due process. An impartial hearing officer was appoint
ed on December 7, 2009 and a pre-hearing conference was held on December 15, 2009. A resolution meeting was 
held by the parties.  Hearing dates of December 

22, 2009 and December 23, 2009 were chosen by the parties.
  In a letter from the 
Parents&#8482; attorney, the 
hearing officer was informed that the matter was sett
led and the Parents requested that the hearing be 
withdrawn without prejudice.
