FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

Issues:

1. Was the District responsible to, and subsequently fail, to identify and evaluate the Student
prior to her third birthday?

2‘ Did the District fail to provide a free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”) t0 the
Student from November 12, 2010 until September 6, 201 1?

3. Did the District fail to provide a FAPE to the Student by failing to provide an appropriate
Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) by placing the Student in the kindergarten
program, rather than allowing the Student to remain in her pre—kindcrgarteu placement, and
did the IEP provide the appropriate services and program for the Student?

4. If the District failed to provide the Student with an appropriate IEP with appropriate services
and program, is the District responsible to reimburse the Parents for the cost of their
unilateral placement of the Student and the subsequent services and program costs incurred
as a result of that unilateral placement?

Procedural Histmy:

This matter is before the Hearing Ofﬁcer pursuant to a Request for Due Process hearing,
ﬁled by the Parent and received by the Board on October 16, 2012, and identiﬁed as Case No, 13-
0176. A preheating conference was held on November 6, 2012.

The issues for the due process hearing were identiﬁed at that time and are listed below. The Parties
indicated that a resolution meeting would be held on November 7, 2012. The resolution meeting
was held and was not successful and the Parties agreed to attempt mediation to resolve the issues‘
The ﬁrst Due Process Hearing date was scheduled for December 12, 2012,

January 22, 2013 Final Decision and Order: 13-0176

On November 14, 2012 the Parties requested a thirty day extension to allow for mediation and to
postpone the December 12, 2012 Due Process Hearing date, The request was granted, with the
date for the ﬁnal decision and order extended to January 28, 2013. Mediation was held on
December 12, 2012, with the Due Process Hearing being postponed until January 9, 2013,

On December 27, 2012 counsel for the Board indicated via email that mediation had been
successful and that an “agreement in principle” had been reached, a request to postpone the January
9, 2013 Due Process Hearing unti1 January 1 1, 2013 was also requested. The request was granted.

On January 10, 2013 the Parent requested to postpone the Due Process I'learing as no formal
agreement had been reached, the Hearing Officer was also notiﬁed by the 1'ep011ing agency that
illness was making it difﬁcult to provide staff for that date and a continuance was requested. The
hearing date was postponed until January 17, 2013 to accommodate the Parties.

On January 16, 2013, at 12:53pm, the Parent requested via email to “cancel the hearing tomorrow
with prejudice”. Shortly thereaﬁer Counsel for the Board attempted to clarify that the Parties had a
formalized agreement and that they believed the Parent wanted to “withdraw the complaint with
prejudice” and requested if the hearing date would be held, Given the short amount ol‘time that
notice was provided and the somewhat confusing message by the Parent, the Hearing Officer
notiﬁed the Parties that the hearing would continue as scheduled in less than 24 hours.

On January 17, 2013 the Hearing was opened and the Parent stated on the record that the Parties had
reached an agreement and that the Parent requested to withdraw the complaint with prejudice The
Board had no objection to the request to withdraw. The matter was then dismissed with prejudice
and the Hearing was closed.
