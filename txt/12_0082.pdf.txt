FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been as identiﬁed as Other Health Impaired and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate
public education (“FAPE”) as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA)
20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq_ and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a. At a PPT meeting, the Board questioned the
appropriateness of the placement at Hope Academy. The Parents requested continued placement at Hope
Academy for the 201 1—2012 school year. On August 24, 2011, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request
for due process. The panties agreed to go to mediation in place of a resolution meeting.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on August 24, 201 1 and a pre-hearing conference was held on
September 1, 201 1. A hearing date of October 7, 201 l was chosen by the parties. In an electronic transmission,
the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties were able to resolve the matter in mediation and
that the parties needed additional time to formalize the agreement. On November 16, 201 1, the Parents’
attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the agreement had been ﬁnalized and the matter may be withdrawn
with prejudice. The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the
parties’ mediation and the hearing date. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is November 22,

201 1.
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is dismissed with prejudice.
