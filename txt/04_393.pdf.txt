Should the Student, who is identified as in need of special education under the classification of intellectual disability, be placed in regular education with supplementary aids and supports and modifications to the curriculum?  PROCEDURAL HISTORY   On December 15, 2004 the Parents filed a due process request seeking a hearing to challenge the appropriateness of the IEP and the failure of the Board to comply with the IDEA.  The case was assigned to this Hearing Officer on December 17, 2004.  By way of relief they request the appointment of a mutually acceptable independent consultant to assist in the development and implementation of an appropriate IEP and regular classroom placement with appropriate supplementary aids and supports and modifications to the curriculum in accordance with the recommendations of the independent evaluator.  They also request payment of the fee of the independent evaluator.  Hearing Officer ("HO") Exhibit 1.  On December 28 a prehearing conference was held.  The Parents' attorney stated that the independent consultant requested is someone from the University of Connecticut Center on Excellence, which is part of the medical center.  Hearing dates were agreed on for January 14 and February 9, 14, 15 and
