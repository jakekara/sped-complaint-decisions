PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On December 2, 2016, the Board received a request for a special education due process hearing
ﬁled by Attorney for the Student. On December 5, 2016, the Connecticut State Department of
Education appointed this Hearing Ofﬁcer to preside over the matter. During the prehearing
conference held on December 19, 2016, the parties agreed to set February 6, 2017 as the hearing
date and the deadline for mailing the ﬁnal decision and order was established as February 15,
2017. A request for postponement of the hearing dates was made by Attorney for the Parent on

J anuary 31, 2017. This request was denied and the hearing was opened on February 6, 2017. At
that time Counsel indicated that there was an agreement in principal and Attorney for the Student
requested that a second hearing date be set in the event the written agreement could not be
ﬁnalized. There was no obj ection to this request by the Board. The parties agreed to set February
21, 2017 as the second hearing date and jointly requested an extension of the mailing deadline
from February 15, 2017 to February 17, 2017 to allow for the drafting of the ﬁnal order and
decision. Attomey for the Student withdrew the request for a hearing with prejudice on February
1 0, 2017.
