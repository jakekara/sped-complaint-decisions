 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
  This proceeding was commenced on behalf 
of the Student by letter dated April 20, 2006 to the District and stamped receiv
ed by the Department of Education&#8482;s (&#64257;DOE&#8482;s&#64258;) Due Process Unit on April 24, 2006.  The Student is 19 years old and the Parents claim that at a Planning and Pl
acement Team (&#64257;PPT&#64258;) meeting convened on 
February 1, 2006, the Parents had requested a residential placement of the Student at 
VISTA.  The Parents report that the District agreed to fund the educational component of 
a placement at VISTA, that they requeste

District fund the entire cost of the placemen

request.  For purposes of this proceeding, the 
date for issuance of a final decision and order (absent any modification of the timelin

District to the Parents that 
was copied to the Hearing Officer indicated that the parties planned to convene a resolution meeting on Ma
y 30, 2006.  In light of that arrangement, 

the Hearing Officer delayed convening a pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;).  On May 31, 2006, counsel for the Parents reported that the parties had reached a settlement of their 
disputes at the resolution mee
ting and were reducing the agreement to writing.  In light of 
that report, the Hearing Officer advised the parties that he would defer scheduling a PHC until the week of June 26, 2006 to permit the 
parties an opportunity to complete their 
settlement agreement.   
  A PHC convened on June 30, 2006.  Due to connection difficulties, the Hearing 

Officer spoke first with counsel for the Parents and then subsequently with counsel for the District.  Each counsel confirmed that they had reached an agreement to resolve the 
dispute but had not yet executed a final settlement agreement.  The settlement that had
