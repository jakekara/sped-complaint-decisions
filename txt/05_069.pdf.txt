Hearing Officer  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER SUMMARY:  This matter was assigned on March 21, and a prehearing conference was held on 
March 24.  An extension of the mailing date of the decision, filed by the Parent&#8482;s 
attorney, was granted after review of the exhibits submitted by the parties, and the first 
hearing date was scheduled for May 12.  The Board&#8482;s attorney submitted a request to add 

additional counter-issues to this hearing, which request was granted.   The Parent&#8482;s attorney submitted a notice that the case was in the process of being 

settled, and that the case should be withdrawn without prejudice at this time, and then the 
Parent&#8482;s attorney would subsequently withdraw the case with prejudice when the settlement agreement was fully executed.  The Board&#8482;s attorney submitted a notice that it 

was withdrawing its counter-issues on May 9.   The Parent&#8482;s notice to withdraw the case now, and revise the withdrawal later is 

not sufficiently unequivocal to constitute an appropriate withdrawal of the request for due 
process.  It appears that the Parent&#8482;s attorney requests a retention of hearing officer&#8482;s jurisdiction until the settlement agreement is finalized.  However, the Parent&#8482;s attorney 

has submitted notice that the matter is withdrawn, which is construed as a notice that the 
Parent is no longer prosecuting this due process hearing request.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The matter is 
DISMISSED.
