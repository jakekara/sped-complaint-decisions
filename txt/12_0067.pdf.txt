FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education
(“FAPE”) as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education ImprovementAct(1DEA) 20 U.S,C. §1401 et
seq, and Connecticut General Statute §10—76a, At a PPT meeting, the Parent rejected the program offered by the
Board for the 201 1-2012 school year and requested an out of district placement. The Board refused the Parent’s

request.

On August 15, 201 1, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request for due process. An impaitial hearing
ofﬁcer was appointed on August 16, 201 1 and a preheating conference was held on September 2, 201 1. A hearing
date of October 18, 201 1 was chosen by the patties.

On August 24, 201 1, the Board ﬁled a sufﬁciency challenge. The due process complaint was found not sufﬁcient
and the Parent’s attomey ﬁled an amended complaint on September 1, 201 1. The amended complaint altered the
timelines of the original request for due process.

In an electronic transmission dated October 18, 201 I, the Parent’s attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the
patties were able to resolve the matter at a resolution meeting and that the matter was withdrawn with prejudice.

The withdrawal with prejudice was granted. The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was
extended to November 14, 201 1 to accommodate the hearing date.
