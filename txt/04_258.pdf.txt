  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  1. Is the program offered by the Board for the 2004-2005 school years appropriate? 
If not;  2. Is the program offered at Maplebrook School in Amenia, New York provide an 
appropriate education as defined in 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a? 
  SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  The Student is a 13 year-old young woman who has been identified as Specific  
Learning Disabled and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education.  The Parents rejected the 2004-2005 IEP and requested placement at Maplebrook School in 
Amenia, New York at the Board&#8482;s expense. The Board refused the Parents&#8482; request and 
the Parents requested a Due Process Hearing.  On July 29, 2004, a Hearing Officer was appointed and a hearing date was scheduled for September 14, 2004.  In order to resolve the matter, the Parents requested a postponement 
of the hearing date. The Hearing Officer granted the request.
