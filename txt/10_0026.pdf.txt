FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
This matter was commenced by request for due pro
cess dated July 9, 2009 (the &#64257;Request&#64258;).  The Request states that the Student is a child identified with
 emotional disturbance, that
 the District at an IEP team meeting on March 17, 2009 denied a request that
 the District place th
e Student at Winston 
Preparatory School, and that a medi
ation held on June 19, 2009 failed to resolve the disagreement.  The 
Parents commenced this proceeding to secure Distri
ct funding for a placement at Winston Preparatory 
School. The undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer by notice dated July 17, 2009. Absent modification by the Hearing Officer, the date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order (&#64257;FD&O&#64258;) 
would have been September 22, 2009. By agreement of the parties a 
telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) convened on August 6, 2009. Each party participated through counsel, who re
ported that the parties had reached an agreement 
settling this matter and were proceeding to document 
that agreement.  By agreement of the parties no 
hearing dates or procedural schedule was issued. 
 The parties ultimately reported on October 2, 2009 

that both parties had executed the settlement document. 
The date for the mailing of the FD&O is hereby 
extended to and including October 9, 2009.    This matter is hereby DISMISSED with prejudice.
