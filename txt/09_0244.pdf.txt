DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
  Student v. Fairfield Board of Education   
 Appearing for the Student: Parent, 
pro se   Appearing for the Board: Michelle Laubin 
Berchem, Moses & Devlin, PC 

75 Broad Street 
Milford, CT 06460  
Appearing Before:  Scott Myers,

 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  This matter was commenced by request fo
r due process dated December 4, 2008 sent 
by the Student&#8482;s father (the &#64257;Parent&#64258;) to the Connecticut Department of Education&#8482;s 
Bureau of Special Education, Due Process 
Unit on that date.  Accordingly, absent modification by the Hearing Officer the date for mailing of the Final Decision and Order 
would have been February 17, 2009.  The request for due process indicates that the Student is in high school, challenges the outcome of a November 3, 2008 IEP team 
meeting and asserts claims of a denial of 
FAPE within the meani
ng of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400, 
et. seq. (the &#64257;IDEIA&#64258;), with respect to the 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 school years.  More specifically:  1. Is the &#64257;alternative high school program&#64258; the Student attends providing him with a 

FAPE in the LRE? 

 2. Should the District have provided a cl
assroom aide to &#64257;mitigate concerns 
regarding [the Student&#8482;s] classroom behavior?&#64258; 
 3. Is it &#64257;appropriate for the [D]istrict
 to emphasize subjective and changing 
behavioral criteria at the expense of [the Student] being provided a meaningful 
educational benefit?&#64258; 

 4. [Have any of the special education services provided by Fairfield benefited [the Student]?  If so, have they outwe
ighed the costs to [the Student]?&#64258; 
 
As the Hearing Officer understands it, the Parent is primarily seeking a determination that 
the Student&#8482;s home high school is 
the Student&#8482;s LRE placement.
