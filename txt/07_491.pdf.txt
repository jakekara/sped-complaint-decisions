 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
 (June 4, 2008)  OVERVIEW
  
 This matter is being dismissed withou
t prejudice and no determinations on the 
merits of the claims asserted are being ma
de.  Given the nature and extent of the disagreements between the parties, the Heari
ng Officer concludes it would be helpful to summarize herein the proceedings in this matter. 
 BACKGROUND  A. Request for Due Process 
 This matter was commenced by request dated April 24, 2008 and concerns an IEP 
team meeting
1 which scheduled for May 20, 2008.  The Student is expected to graduate high school in June 2008 and the IEP team m
eeting at issue was to have been a final meeting at which she would be exited from e
ligibility for special education and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, 20 U.S.C. 

&#167;&#167; 1400, et. seq. (the &#64257;IDEIA&#64258;).  The request for due process states as follows:  
Region 6 is currently under investigation [by] the [Office of Civil Rights] for an abusive retaliatory action taken by Dr. Sharon Bremner against me.  I would like 
to have my exit PPT at [out of district
 placement] with a representative from 
Region 6 participating by speaker phone.  It would be intimidating to have Dr. 
bremner [sic] in my presence as I feel sh
e deliberately tried to
 hurt me because I 
complained about being bullied.  Dr. br
emner [sic] is refusing to honor this 
request and insists she must be at my PPT
 in person to continue her retaliatory 
actions against me. 
                                                 1 Terms used but not defined herein have the same meaning as is ascribed to them in the IDEIA.
