 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY  

 
The Parents requested this hearing by letter dated May 25 to the Norwalk Board of 
Education's Director of Speci
al Education.  The Board a
nd the State Department of 
Education ("SDE") received the request on Ma
y 29.  This Hearing Officer was assigned 
to the case on May 30.  A prehearing conference was held on June 18.  The decision deadline was set at August 13, 2007.  Hearing dates were agreed on for July 24, 26 and 31.  The parties participated in mediation on July 12.  On
 July 13, the SDE advised the Hearing Officer that the parties had not reach
ed an agreement at the mediation, but were 
continuing settlement discussions and that th
e Parents' attorney would advise regarding 
the status of the hearing.  On July 13, the Parents' attorney wrote to the Hearing Officer 
and reported that the parties had scheduled an advisory hearing for 
July 31 and requested that the July 24, 26 and 31 hearing dates be canceled.  
The request for postponement was granted, 
the hearing was rescheduled for August 15 and the mailing date for the final decision 
was extended to September 10.  On August 1, 
the Hearing Officer on the advisory hearing sent
 a notice to this Hearing Officer that the 
parties had reached a partial resolution on July 31.  On August 6, the Board's attorney 

made a joint request for a postponement of th
e August 15 hearing so that the parties could continue settlement discussions to reach a 
final resolution or narrow the issues for the 
hearing.  The request was granted, the hearing was rescheduled for September 10 and the mailing date for the final decision was ex
tended to October 10, 2007.  On September 6, 
the Board's attorney made a 
joint request to postpone the September 10 hearing for three 
to four weeks in order to provide additional time for the new Director of Special 
Education to familiarize herself with the matter.  In the event that a postponement was 

denied, the Parents' attorney
 would withdraw the case with
out prejudice.  On September
