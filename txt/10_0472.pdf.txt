tricia M. Strong, Hearing Officer FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
ISSUE: Should the Hearing Officer order a 45-day change in
 placement for the Student from the public school to an appropriate interim alternative 
educational setting pursuant to 34 C.F.R., Section 300.532(b)(2)(ii) for the reason that maintaining the child&#8482;s current
 placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to 
others? PROCEDURAL HISTORY: 
The Board&#8482;s attorney faxed a letter to the State Department of Education (&#64257;SDE&#64258;) on June 7, 2010 
requesting an expedited due process hearing.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on June 9, 2010. On June 14, 2010, the Parents&#8482; filed a Motion to Consolidate requesting that this case be consolidated with a case filed by the Parents against the Board, which wa
s assigned to another hearing officer.  A prehearing conference was held on June 16, 2010. The Board objected to
 consolidating this case with the other hearing officer because of the emergency nature of the Board&#8482;s 
due process request.  There was a difference of opinion 
between the attorneys as to setting timelines for the h

were 13 school days between the June 7, 2010 filing date and the end of the school year on June 23, 2010.  The 
Hearing Officer determined that the 
extended school year days would be counted in setting the timelines.  One 
hearing date was agreed on for July 7, 2010.  The mailing da
te for the final decision was set at July 21, 2010. 
On June 17, 2010, after conferring with the other hearing officer who referred that case to this Hearing Officer, the Parents&#8482; Motion to Consolidate was granted. 
On June 18, 2010, the Board&#8482;s attorney filed a joint request to postpone the July 7, 2010 hearing date to July 21 so that the parties could pursue mediation 
on July 8, 2010.  On June 28, 2010, the Parents&#8482; attorney 
requested that the June 30, 2010 due date for filing witn
