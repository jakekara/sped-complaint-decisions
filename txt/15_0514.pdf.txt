F INAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUE:

Did the Board deny the Student a free and appropriate education (F APE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE) by failing to implement the 2014—2015 individualized education program (IEP)?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public
education in the least restrictive environment as deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education
Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq.

At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents stated that the Board had failed to
implement the 2014-2015 IEP. The Board denied the Parents’ statement and the Parents requested due
process. The Board received notice of the due process request on May 15, 2015. The parties advised
the hearing ofﬁcer that they would mediate the matter. The parties mediated on June 16, 2015 but
mediation was not successful. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on May 18, 2015 and a pre-
hearing conference was held on May 26, 2015. The parties chose July 9 and 15, 2015 as hearing dates.

The Parents opened the J uly 9, 2015 hearing to the public. Members of the public who attended the
hearing identiﬁed themselves on the record and were informed that they could not record or photograph
the proceedings, and, if they required a copy of the proceedings, they should contact the Parents.

In order to attempt to resolve the matter and at the request of the parties, the hearing was adj ourned. The
parties were informed that the next hearing date would proceed without any further adjournments for
discussions to resolve the matter. The panties later advised the hearing ofﬁcer that they had resolved the
issue and the Parents withdrew their hearing request. The J uly 15, 2015 hearing date was cancelled.

The mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is July 29, 2015.
