 SUMMARY:  The Board filed this request for hearing on April 27, 2009 and a prehearing conference was convened on May 11, 2009.   The Board filed an initial request
 for extension of the mailing date
 of the decision to attempt to 
resolve this matter with the Parent.  The Board file
d a second request to extend the mailing date of the 
final decision and a request to postpone the June
 24, 2009 hearing date because the Board had obtained 
some information that the Student

verify this information.  The matter was then sc
heduled for a hearing on July 23, 2009.  Prior to the scheduled hearing date, the Board submitted notificati
on that it had determined that the Student is not 
currently residing in Norwalk and that therefore, the Board did not have responsibility for providing educational services to the Student.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
  `The matter is 
DISMISSED, without prejudice.
