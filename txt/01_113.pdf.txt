May 14, 2001 -1- Final Decision and Order 01-113  STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION    Student v. West Haven Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parents: Attorney Jennifer D. Laviano, P.C.      77 Danbury Road &#338; Suite C-6      Ridgefield, Connecticut 06877  Appearing on behalf of the Board: Attorney Michelle Laubin      Berchem, Moses & Devlin, P.C.      75 Broad Street      Milford, Connecticut 06460  Appearing before:   Attorney Christine B. Spak, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   SUMMARY:   This hearing was scheduled for a prehearing conference on May 4, 2001. Both parties were represented by counsel. Neither counsel was available at the time of the prehearing conference and the Hearing Officer left a voice message for both. Later that same day the Board counsel telecopied the Hearing Officer with a copy of letters the Parent&#8482;s counsel wrote on May 1, 2001 indicating that she was withdrawing the case. These were not sent or copied to the Hearing Officer prior to the Board&#8482;s counsel sending them after the scheduled time of the prehearing. Along with copies of these letters the Board&#8482;s counsel requested confirmation that the matter had been withdrawn. This was copied by the Board&#8482;s counsel to the Parent&#8482;s counsel. The Hearing Officer has not received a withdrawal from the Parent&#8482;s counsel. Given that the Hearing Officer has not received the withdrawal from the Parent&#8482;s counsel, but there is the indication that she intended to withdraw, this matter is dismissed.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:   This matter is dismissed.
