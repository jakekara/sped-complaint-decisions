Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General

date of December 18, 2015 was chosen by the parties but in an electronic transmission dated December
17, 2015, the hearing ofﬁcer was advised that the matter had been resolved and was withdrawn with
prejudice. The mailing date of the Final Decision and Order is December 24, 2015 .
