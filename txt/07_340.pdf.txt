Appearing before:  Attorney Deborah R. Kearns, Hearing Officer  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  
 
ISSUES  
 I. Whether the LEA must convene a PPT 
at the request of a mother whose 
divorce decree grants legal custody and medical and e
ducational decisions to the father. 
  PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 The Mother requested that the local educational agency convene a planning and placement team meeting to address whether the child requires special education 

services.  The Father with le
gal custody declined to partic
ipate or provide consent for such a meeting.  The local educational 
agency requested the Parents provide documentation of their respective rights to make or decline the request for a PPT.  

The documentation provided is in the fo
rm of a Memorandum of Decision which 
does not sufficiently clarify whether the Mother could request a PPT meeting or 
whether the Father could prevent the meeti
ng from occurring.  The Mother requested a special education due process hearing pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401 et seq. as amended. 

 
The hearing was convened to address the local educational agency&#8482;s (LEA&#8482;s) Motion 
for Joinder.  The Father testified he agr
eed to be joined as a party, the claimant 
Mother did not object to the Father being joined as a party in the due process hearing.  The Motion for Joinder was granted and is therefore not addressed in the decision. 
 
The Father testified he would not provide consent to the school to evaluate the child 
or consent to initial placement of the child
 in a special education program.  The LEA
