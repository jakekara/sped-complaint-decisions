SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as Other Health Impaired and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U,S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut
General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parent rejected the
program offered by the Board for the 2012-2013 school year. The Parent requested placement of the Student at
Eagle Hill in Greenwich, Connecticut for the 2012-2013 school year. The Board refused the Parent’s request.

On or about July 9, 2012, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request for due process. The parties agreed
to go to a resolution meeting. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on July 12, 2012 and a pre—hearing
conference was held on July 17, 2012. Hearing dates of September 6 and 7, 2012 were chosen by the parties.
In an electronic transmission, the Parent’s attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties were able to

resolve the matter at the resolution meeting and that the matter was withdrawn with prejudice. The withdrawal
with prejudice was granted. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is September 21, 2012.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is dismissed with prejudice.
