F INAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et
seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program provided by the
Board for the 2015—2016 school year and requested reimbursement for their unilateral placement of the
Student at Eagle Hill-Greenwich for the 2015-2016 school year; the Board refused the Parents’ request. On

forego a resolution meeting and proceed to mediation.
