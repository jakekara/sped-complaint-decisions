Madison Middle School appropriate to the Student’s special education needs in the
least restrictive environment?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This hearing was requested by Parents on August 12, 2011, and the Hearing Ofﬁcer was
appointed on August 16, 201 1. The date for mailing the decision was October 26, 201 1.

A pre-hearing conference was held on September 8, 201 1. At that time, the Parties
reported that they had requested mediation from the State Depaltment of Education, but a
date had not yet been set. The Parties requested an extension of the mailing date to
accommodate settlement negotiations; the Hearing Ofﬁcer granted that request and
extended the mailing date to November 25, 201 1. The hearing was scheduled for
November 1, 7, 9, 14 and 21, 201 1. The Panies requested another extension of the

mailing date to accommodate the additional hearing days, and the Hearing Ofﬁcer
extended the mailing date for the decision to December 23, 201 1.

The Parents informed the Hearing Officer on October 20, 201 1, that the Parties had
agreed to an evaluation and a Planning and Placement Team meeting to review the results
of that evaluation, and requested that hearing dates of November 1, 7 and 8, 201 1, be
postponed. The Hearing Ofﬁcer consented to that request. The Parents informed the
Hearing Ofﬁcer on November 8, 201 1, that a settlement had been delayed by the early
snow storm, resulting in extensive power outages and school closings, and requested that
the hearing scheduled for November 14 be postponed. The Hearing Ofﬁcer consented to
that request. Subsequently, the Parties requested that the November 21 hearing session
be cancelled because an agreement was being ﬁnalized. On December 19, 201 1, Parents
informed the Hearing Ofﬁcer that the agreement had been fully executed and asked that
the case be dismissed with prejudice.

A11 motions and objections not previously ruled upon, if any, are hereby overruled,

In order to comply with the conﬁdentiality requirements of the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act 0f1974, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g and related regulations at 34 C.F.R, §
99, the following decision uses “Student”, “School”, “Parent” and titles of school staff
members and other witnesses in place of names and other personally identiﬁable
information.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The request for hearing having been withdrawn after an agreement was made between the
Patties, this matter is DISMISSED with prejudice.
