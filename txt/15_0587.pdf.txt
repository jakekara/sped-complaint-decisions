On June 11, 2015, the Board received Parents’ request for a Special Education Due Process

2015. On June 30, 2015, Attorney for the Parents ﬁled a request for an extension of the mailing
deadline in order to accommodate the agreed upon hearing date schedule. There was no

obj ection to this request from the Board. After a consideration of all of the relevant factors, the
