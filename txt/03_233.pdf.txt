 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  This hearing was requested on July 14, 2003.  The prehearing conference was held on July 31, 2003.  Initially, the parent requested a placement at CREC Riverstreet School.  
In a letter dated October 2, 2003, the school district learned that CREC Riverstreet could not offer the Student a placement at that time.  This letter was sent to parent&#8482;s counsel on 

October 14 as a proposed exhibit.  At the hearing on October 16, 2003, the parent moved 
to amend their issues.  The school district objected and moved to dismiss the hearing.  
The hearing officer requested that the parties brief the issues; briefs were received on 
October 24, 2003.  The parent&#8482;s motion to amend the hearing issues was granted and the 
school district motion to dismiss was denied.  
The issues were amended to read as stated 
above.  The hearing was convened on the following dates:  September 8, October 2 and 
16, November 20, and December 16, 19 and 23, 2003.  Briefs were submitted in a timely
