September 6, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0170

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

On September 23, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parent’s (Mother) request for due
process. The parties agreed to go to a resolution session.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer (not the undersigned hearing ofﬁcer) was appointed on September
25, 2015 (Hearing Ofﬁcer’s Exhibit1 No. 2), a pre-hearing conference was held on September 4,
2015. Hearing dates ofNovember 23, 2015, January 14 and 25, February 4, March 8, 11 and 14,
April 4, 13, 25 and 26, and May 10, 16 and 24, 2016 were chosen by the parties. The January 14,
March 8, 11 and 14 and May 16, 2016 hearing dates were cancelled. The January 14, 2016
hearing date was cancelled due to the birth of the Father’s child. The March 8, 11 and 14, 2016
hearing dates were cancelled due to a personal issue of the hearing ofﬁcer. There was no
objection to the cancelled hearing dates. The Board presented Exhibits2 N0. 1 thru 65 which
were full exhibits of the hearing. Parent Mother presented Exhibits 1 through 9. Parent Mother’s
Exhibits3 N0. 2 and 3 were not received as exhibits. P-2 was beyond the scope of the hearing and
P—3 is a duplicate of Board Exhibit No. 24. The Pro Se Father did not present any exhibits for the
hearing.

An unsuccessful resolution session was held on October 15, 2015. (H.O.-21). On October 26,
2015, the Father ﬁled a Motion to Intervene. (H.O.-11). On October 28, 2015, the hearing ofﬁcer
granted the Motion to Intervene. (H.O.—13). The F ather ﬁled a Motion challenging the Mother’s
right to ﬁle for due process without his authorization as the Superior Court had granted the
Parents joint legal custody and joint educational decision making. The Hearing Ofﬁcer denied
the Father’s objection. (H.O.-21).

On November 12, 2015, the Hearing Ofﬁcer recused herself from this hearing. (H.O.-l4). On
November 13, 2015, this Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed to this matter. (H.O.-17). On November
17, 2015, the F ather was advised that ex parte communications with the Hearing Ofﬁcer were
not allowed and that all parties must be included in the distribution of any and all correspondence
that was addressed to the Hearing Ofﬁcer. (H.O.-27, 28, 29, 30, 54, 55).

On December 17, 2015, the Mother’s attorney ﬁled a Motion to Enforce Stay-Put. The Board
and the F ather ﬁled timely objections. On January 10, 2016, the hearing ofﬁcer denied the
Mother’s motion. (H.O.-38).

The Mother requested to have the Student testify at the hearing. The Board and the F ather
obj ected to the Student being called as a witness. The Mother’s motion was denied in that the
Student would not be a witness for the Mother, but could be a rebuttal witness if necessary,

At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the hearing, a brieﬁng schedule was discussed and
the paities agreed to ﬁle simultaneous post—ti‘ial briefs on July 18, 2016. The briefs were timely
ﬁled by both parties. The parties were instructed that any factual references and arguments

' Hereafter Hearing Ofﬁcer’s Exhibits will be noted as “HO.” followed by the number 0fthe exhibit.
2 Hereafter Board’s Exhibits will be noted as “B” followed by the number of the exhibit.
3 Hereaﬁer Parent Mother’s Exhibits will be noted as “P” followed by the number of the exhibit.

FINDINGS OF FACT:

1. The Student is diagnosed with Autism and is eligible to receive special education and
related services as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement
Act (“IDEA”) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10—76a.
(Board’s Exhibit No. 23).

2. The Student’s Parents are divorced and have joint legal custody of the Student; both have
the right to make decisions concerning the Student’s education. (Testimony of Mother,
H.O.- 13)

3. The Student was originally diagnosed as Learning Disabled. In the third grade his
diagnosis was changed to Autism. The Mother was satisﬁed with the services the Student
was receiving. (Testimony of Administrator of Pupil Services (APP), Testimony of
Mother)

4. On March 28, 2013, a PPT was held to plan the Student’s triennial evaluation. The
Student was then in the ﬁfth grade. The Parents attended the PPT and the Mother was
assisted by her attorney. The Mother was concerned that the Student was struggling
academically and having problems doing the work. The Board agreed to evaluations and
the Father questioned the need for an independent evaluation. The PPT determined that
the triennial evaluation would include cognitive, attention, academic, speech and
language, social skills and ﬁne motor/sensory evaluations. The Parents gave peimission
for the Board to conduct the evaluations. (Testimony of Mother, B—40)

5. The Mother administered the Woodcoek-Johnson test to the Student in her home. The
Mother is a teacher in another school district. She does not remember the form of the test
administered and admitted that the environment was not the same as a school setting. The
test was provided by a family relative and that neither the testing nor 1'esu1ts were
provided to the sehooI. (Testimony of Mother)

In December 2013, the F ather requested an Independent Psychological Reevaluation of
the Student as had been suggested at the March 28, 2013 PPT. The reevaluation was to be
conducted by Dr. William Nelson as part of the Student’s triennial evaluation. Dr.
Nelson had, in prior years, conducted an evaluation of the Student. The Board agreed
with the F ather’s request. The Father, on December 6, 2013, signed an agreement to
amend the March 28, 2013 IEP without conducting a PPT. (B-39, B-40)

The reevaluation by Dr. Nelson did not take place. The doctor withdrew as the evaluator
after receiving a call from the Mother, which he perceived as a threat to report him to the
licensing board. (Testimony of APP)

The school psychologist performed the Psycho-educational Evaluation as pait of the
Student’s triennial evaluation. The evaluation was submitted on January 10, 2014. The
evaluator recommended that:
a. The Student would beneﬁt from an increased structured social experience in the
community.
b. Extended time in class to respond to questions, in writing, as well as on all
assessments due to weak processing speed.
0. Additional support from the school psychologist to address weak social skills.
d. Parents to begin working on increasing his independence with adaptive skills.
e. Strategies to decrease autism mannerisms.
(B-32)

On J anuary 22, 2014, the PPT was reconvened to review evaluations that had been
performed. The Parents consented to a sensory assessment, physical therapy evaluation
and a functional behavior assessment (FBA). (B—36, B-37)

The Student’ Clinical Evaluation of Language F undamentals-S (CELF-S) showed growth
in four of ﬁve areas: core language, receptive language, expressive language and
language memory. The language content which probes vocabulary and word knowledge
had decreased. The evaluator attributed this decrease to the increase in abstract language
skills which are typical for this age group. (B—34)

The Student also showed difﬁculty in following tasks and the processing of paragraph
length information as well as pragmatic language skills. A checklist is ﬁlled out by
parents and teachers to gain infolmation about a student’s verbal and nonverbal
pragmatic skills. An obsewation rating scale had been sent to the Mother but had not
been returned.(B-34, Testimony of APP)

On March 19, 2014, a FBA 0f the Student was completed by Capital Regional Education

Council (CREC). The FBA made the following recommendations:

a. Small group settings.

b 1-1 pl'e-teaching of topics and vocabulary.

c. Obsewations to either support 01‘ refute the premise of off—task behaviors as an issue
that requires intervention.

d. A clear spectrum of objectives in the IEP to address social behaviors and adaptive
social communications.

6. Paraprofessionals available to assist the Student.

f. Measures of the Student’s ability to maintain focused and attentive in small and large
group instructional formats as a component of receptive language.

g. Embedded academic objectives in the whole group setting that measures the
Student’s capacity to follow instruction and adaptively respond to questions/prompts
over an increased period of time. (B-31)

On March 24, 2014, a PPT was convened to conduct the Student’s annual review and
review the reports of the evaluations that had been conducted. Results indicate that
besides delays with gross and ﬁne motor skills, the Student is able to function in the
school environment and does not qualify for direct services. The Father felt that two
observations by the Board Certiﬁed Behavior Analyst (BCBA) were not sufﬁcient. The
team agreed to an additional observation by the BCBA. The Mother stated that the
Student required additional support from the paraprofessional. She requested 1-1
paraprofessional support and an out—of-distriet placement. The team refused both
requests. The Student was offered extended school year (ESY) services for the 2014-
2015 school year. It was recommended that the Student attend a social skills group twice
a week during ESY. The Father was in agreement and the Mother was not. (8—28,
Testimony of Mother, Testimony of APP, B-29)

The team refused the mother’s request for an out—of—district placement because they were
of the opinion that the District school is the LRE for the Student. The F ather was not in
agreement with an out-of-district placement. The Mother did not recommend any speciﬁc
placement. (Testimony of APP)

On May 15, 2014 a PPT was held to provide additional accommodations to the Student
and schedule an AT evaluation to be reviewed in October 2014. (B—27)

The Mother stated at the May 15, 2014 PPT that independent physical therapy and
occupational therapy evaluations had been completed by Pediﬂex. The team would
reconvene to review the evaluations once presented to the District. (Testimony of Mother,
B-27)

The evaluations were never provided to the PPT because they were similar to the
evaluations performed by the Board. In an email to the evaluator, the Mother asked the
evaluator to provide better recommendations because she could not use them in the due
process hearing, stating, “The evaluations were useless.” She accused the evaluator of not
reading the Student’s IEP. (Testimony of Mother, B-27, B—62)

The additional observation performed on May12, 2014 by the BCBA that had been
agreed to in the March 24, 2014 PPT showed that sustained work remains intact early in
the day with a clear decrease in focus during an extended period of time. The evaluator
stated that the original recommendations from the original FBA remained relevant for
review and potential implementation as deemed necessary. (B-24, P—5-2).

During the 2013-2014 school year, the Student was able to master Goals 1, 6 and 7. The
Student made satisfactory progress in all of his other goals. The Student’s lowest grade
was a C+ in English. (B—2, B—63)

On October 2, 2014, a PPT was held at the request of the Mother. Mother expressed
concerns about Student being below grade level and also stated that he had a vomiting
disorder. The Board was not aware of the new medical issue; the Father signed releases
for the school nurse to speak with the Student’s pediatrician and the school psychologist
to speak with the Student’s therapist. The Mother took the release forms home because
there were other physicians she wanted included in the releases. (B—l7)

The Student’s private psychologist, Dr. Pines, spoke with the school psychologist. Dr.
Pines was no longer treating the Student. The Student’s psychologist was of the opinion
that home stressors were the cause of the Student’s anxiety. (Testimony of School
Psychologist Holzer)

During the 2014-2015 school year the Student received support from a paraprofessional.
He received one on one services in Physical Education, Reading and Arts and Crafts. In
science class the paraprofessional provided services to 2-3 students. The Student’s
teacher provided the majority of suppmt to the Student. The paraprofessional would look
over his work and if she saw an error would ask him to review the work and see what is
wrong. In one of his papers, the Student dictated his answer and she ﬁlled it in because
the Student’s hands were wet since the projected required him to be pulling out sand from
water. (Testimony of Paraprofessional M.H., P—4 pg. 7)

The paraprofessional would communicate with the teacher when the Student was tired or
having difﬁculty with his work. Student used a notebook computer that had programs on
it including a word prediction program. When the Student was absent, the
paraprofessional would take notes and provide them to the Student. Other students would
talk to the Student and include him in their group. The Student felt more comfortable
with adults but would sit at a table with peers. (Testimony of Paraprofessional M.H.)

During the 2014-2015 school year, the Student took a course called Young Inventors.
The noise from the machinery made the Student anxious and bothered him. At the
beginning, he would step out of class because of the noise. The Student was provided
with noise suppressor headsets. The ﬁrst step in the course was reverse engineering for
which the students were given a project. The Student became acclimated to the Class.
(Testimony of Teacher S.W.)

The Student’s project was restoring a battery operated vacuum cleaner. The Student
became engrossed in his project. The teacher obtained donated vacuum cleaners which
the Student repaired. He would research the vacuum cleaner on the classroom computer
and the teacher would order the parts the Student needed to repair the vacuum cleaners.
Under the direction of his teacher, the Student would repair vacuum cleaners in the class,
sell them and purchase tools. The Student received an A in the class. Although his IEP

allowed for modiﬁcations in his testing, the Student chose to take the test with his peers
and ﬁnished in the allotted time. His peers came to him for assistance in this class and the
Student was willing to help and learned to share with his peers. (Testimony of Teacher
S.W.)

The Young Inventors course was a one semester course. Based on the Student’s interest
and performance in the course, the District allowed him to take the course for another
semester. During the second semester, the Student assisted other students. The course
was a skill-based course, but the Student was able to do the work even better than his
peers. (Testimony of Teacher S.W.)

The Student continues to receive consultative services to support his use of sensory,
motor and adaptive strategies and modiﬁcations. Modifications provided to the Student
include preferential seating, clearing his work surface and breaking activities down into
smaller steps. (B—l4)

The Student received 1-1 counseling if it was needed; otherwise, he had group sessions
every other week for one half hour. There were six students in his group. One to one
sessions occurred when Student’s anxiety was high. He received coping strategies for
anxiety. Home stressors were the main cause of his anxieties. During the 2014-2015
school year, while in school, the Student did demonstrate anxiety. (Testimony of School
Psychologist Holzer)

The updated Assistive Technology report showed that the Student’s typing skills were
improving. His typing speed had decreased; this was attributed to the Student’s use of
formal typing instead of using only his two index ﬁngers. The consultant recommended
that the Student progress to a graphic organizer, an appropriate personal technology
device and explore the use of a speech recognition device if the team felt that the
Student’s writing skills had improved to the point where he could possibly dictate for
writing. (B- 1 0)

On March 18, 2015, the PPT met to conduct an annual review for the 2014-2015 year.
The Student was identiﬁed as an active learner. The Student is able to form his letters
with accommodations. When the Student has a high volume of work, a computer is a
more effective tool. The Student has access to a computer whenever he needs it. He has
also been provided with a personal laptop, which he can take home. For the 2015-2016
school year, the Student will receive ESY for math and social skills. (B-7)

At the March 18, 2015 PPT, the Mother objected to the Father’s wife being present at the
PPT. The Mother and her attorney, despite the Board attorney’s request to avoid any
ﬁnther disruptions of the PPT, continued disrupting the teacher’s repmt concerning the
Student. The PPT was adjourned due to the continued disruptions. The School team
continued the meeting without the Parents. The team also recommended reconvening in
May 2015 for another annual review. (B—29)

Prior to the adjournment of the March 18, 2015 PPT, the Mother requested an out-of—
district placement and direct occupational therapy services. Based on the repmts provided
regarding the Student’s progress, the Board denied the Mother’s request. The Mother also
requested the Student’s raw data. The Team agreed to gather the data and provide dates
for the Parents to come to the school and review it. The Mother requested baseline
testing. Baseline testing is done through standardized testing. (B—29, Testimony of APP)

The Student mastered Goals 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in his 2014—2015 IEP. In Goal Number 3,
which addressed his math skills in everyday problems, the Student made satisfactory
progress. At the March 18, 2015 PPT, it was agreed to provide an ESY for math. The
Student’s lowest grade was a B- in World History. (B-6, B-7)

At the June 10, 2015 PPT, the Mother did not believe the Student’s test scores were
accurate given the accommodations provided. The Mother requested that the team
conduct benchmark tests without accommodations as required in the IEP in order to
reﬂect the Student’s actual perfonnance. The Mother again requested an out-of-district
placement. The Father was not in accord with the Mother’s request. The team refused the
Mother’s request. (B-3)

A paraprofessional provided services to the Student during the 2015-2016 school year.
This was her ﬁrst year working with the Student. While in the classroom, the Student
does not demonstrate any negative behaviors. The paraprofessional does not provide 1—1
services to the Student. She gives the Student positive reinforcements and makes sure that
he has the same material as the other students. She does not edit the Student’s work or
answer any educational questions from the Student. (Testimony of Paraprofessional LP.)

In the 2015-2016 school year, when the Student came to school, he interacted with peers
during group activities and he paiticipated in his history class and asked questions.
(Testimony of 8‘h Grade Histmy Teacher)

At the October 2, 2016 PPT, the school psychologist reported on the 3 objectives in Goal
5 (a social/behavioral goal). The Student had nearly mastered the objectives and was
expected to master them before the end of the 2015—2016 school year. The Student was
showing ﬂexibility with various activities and happily participating with other students in
these activities. The Student was demonstrating the ability to use strategies to decrease
anxiety and seek out support staff when anxious. (B-12, Testimony of School
Psychologist Holzer)

On October 14, 2015, a PPT was held to address the Student’s 15 absences since the start
of the school year. The District had recommended that when the Student refused to come
to school, the mother could call the school and request that school support staff go to the
home to encourage him to come to school. The Mother has not called the school to
request assistance. The Mother signed a1'e1ease for the District to contact the Student’s
pediatrician. (B—l)

At the start of the 2015-2016 school year, the Student was not attending school because
of home issues. Student does not want to go to Father’s house after school. (Testimony of
Mother)

The school psychologist noted that the Student was having hygiene problems which were
conﬁrmed by the Mother. The Mother requested that the occupational therapist address
this issue in her OT consults. The Psychologist recommended an objective be added to
address this issue. The APP recommended that 2 obj ectives be added to his IEP to
address his anxiety around school attendance. The Mother reiterated her request for an
out—of—district placement but did not identify the placement she was seeking. (B—l)

The Student’s 2015—2016 IEP Goal 6 was amended to include two objectives to address
the Student’s school attendance issue. Goal 7 was added to his IEP to address his hygiene
issues. (B—1)

The Mother requested placement at Ben Bronz Academy. The Student has not visited the
school nor has the Mother applied for the Student to attend. Ben Bronz has not accepted
the Student in their program. (Testimony of Mother)

On October 28, 2015, the District advised the Mother that they were sending home
samples of the Student’s school work as she had requested. The District had offered her
the opportunity to review the work in the school, but she did not take advantage of the
appointment dates provided. (B-60)

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW and ARGUMENT:

1.

It is undisputed that the Student is eligible for special education and related services as
set forth in IDEA, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401, et seq. FAPE is deﬁned as special education and
related services that are provided at public expense, meet the standards of the state
educational agency, include an appropriate school education, and that are provided in
conformity with the IEP. 20 U.S.C. §1401(8).

The Board has the burden of proving the appropriateness of the Student’s program and
placement, which burden shall be met by a preponderance of the evidence. (Regulation of
Connecticut State Agencies (R.C.S.A.) Sec. 10-76h-14) The Board has met its burden.

The standard for determining whether a Board has provided FAPE is set forth as a two-
prong inquiry in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v.
Rowley, 458 US. 176 (1982) .The ﬁrst questions to be determined is whether the Board
complied with the procedural requirements of the Act? The second question to be
determined is whether the IEP is “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive
educational benefits?” Rowley, 458 US. at 206-207.

As to the ﬁrst inquiry there was a c1aim presented at the prehearing conference that the
Board had committed procedural Violations. The Parent Mother’s attorney in their Post
Trial Brief stated that the Board denied the Mother meaningful participation in that her

 

September 6, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0170

inquiries were not taken seriously. As the Supreme Couit noted in Rowley, 458 US at
206, Congress’s emphasis in IDEA is “upon the fu11 paiticipation of concerned parties
throughout the development of the IEP.” Compliance with the IDEA’s procedural
requirements is the responsibility of the Board and not the parents. Uniﬁed School
District v. Department of Education, 64 Conn. App. 273, 285 (2001). However, a
procedural Violation of the IDEA does not, in and of itself, warrant a change in the child’s
educational placement. In order to conclude the procedural Violation is a denial of FAPE,
the parent must show the procedural violation caused a loss of educational oppottunity.
See Burke County Bd. OfEduc. v. Benton, 895F.2d 973, 982 (4th Cir. 1999) Procedural
violations do not necessarily require the Hearing Ofﬁcer to ﬁnd that a denial of FAPE has
occurred. However, procedural violations that interfere with parental participation in the
IEP formulation process undermine the very essence of IDEA. Amanda J. ex rel Annette
J. v. Clark County Sch, Dist, 267F.3d 877 (9th Cir. 2001). IDEA expects strong
participation at PPT meetings. Warren G, v. Cumberland County Sch. Dist, 190 F. 3d 80
(3rd Cir. 1993)

5 . The Mother’s issue about not being a meaningful paiticipant is without merit. The
Mother requested a one on one service for the Student; the District was providing one on
one service in the areas which were most criticaI for the Student (Findings of Fact No. 22
and 28). The Mother requested a PPT and the Board agreed (Findings of Fact No. 20); the
Mother complained about the Student’s frequent absences in the beginning of the 2015—
2016 school year and the Board added 2 additional objectives to address the issue. The
Mother presented to the PPT the Student’s hygiene issue and the Board added an
additional objective to his IEP to address this issue. (Findings of Fact No. 40) The
Mother obtained OT and PT evaluations of the Student which she did not share with the
District. She asked the evaluator to amend his recommendations because they were
useless. (F indings of F act No. 17) The Board does not have to comply with each request
of the Mother but must allow her to be a meaningful participant. Procedural Compliance
with the IDEA’S requirements is the responsibility of the Board and not the parents; I ﬁnd
that the Board has complied with IDEA’s requirements.

6. As to the second prong of whether the IEP was reasonably calculated to enable the child
to receive educational beneﬁts, the IDEA does not itself articulate any speciﬁc level of
educational beneﬁt that must be provided through the IEP. The Board fulﬁlls its
obligation under the second inquiry if it provides an appropriate education that is “likely
to produce progress, not regression,” and if the IEP affords the Student with an
opportunity greater than “trivial advancement.” Walczak v. Florida Union Free School
District, 142 F.3d at 130.

7. Appropriateness is determined by focusing on what was 01' was not objectively
reasonable when a snapshot of the IEP was taken. DE and DE on behalf of NF. v.
Ramapo Central School District, 403 F3d. 595 (2d. Circuit 2005). Whether the program
is “individualized on the basis of the Student’s assessments and performance” is also
utilized to determine the appropriateness of an IEP. See A.S. v. Board of Education of
West Hartford, 35 IDELR 179 (D Conn. 2001). As required by the IDEA, the Board

10

reviewed Student’s needs at various PPTs on an individualized basis at appropriate
intervals. (Findings of Fact N0. 9, 13, 20, 30, 37).

When measuring progress, the Rowley Court determines that such objective factors as
“[t]he grading and advancement system” are important measures on acceptable progress.
1d. At 203. Further, “[w]hen the handicapped child is being educated in the regular
classrooms of a public school system, the achievements of passing marks and
advancement from grade to grade will be one important factor to determine educational
beneﬁt.” Id. at 207 n.28. In Mrs. B. vt Milford Board afEducation 103 F.3d 1114, 1121
(2d Cir. 1997), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in interpreting Rowley noted that
“[a] child’s academic progress must be viewed in light of the limitations imposed by the
child’s disability.” The Student’s learning disabilities are complex, interrelated and at
times severe. Sensory issues (iie. loud noises, shaking hand while holding pencil and
chewing shirt and pencils) also interfere with his ability to learn. (B-13) Given these
severe and interrelated disabilities, the Student’s progress has not been as expected by
Mother. However, Student’s steadily improving academic performance shows that the
Board’s program was appropriate. In his Young Inventors class, the Student even
became a mentor and a “go to” person for his peers who might need assistance or advice
on their projects. In the class, he utilized the computer to seek replacement parts. This all
shows growth in the Student’s reading ability, his ability to utilize the computer by
searching and ﬁnding replacement parts and development of motor skills with his typing.
(Findings ofFact Not 19, 23, 29, 35, 38).

In addition to the FAPE requirement, IDEA’s preference is for the student to be educated
in the least restrictive environment capable of meeting their education needs. Walczak,
supra. School Districts must evaluate whether a child with a disability can be educated in
a regular classroom if provided with supplementary aides and services. Roberti v. Board
ofEducation, 995 F.2d 1204 (d Cir. 1993) IDEA’s least restrictive environment
requirement is met when the child with a disability is educated in the regular classroom,
or when the child who cannot be fully included is mainstreamed to the “maximum extent
possible.” Oberti, at 1217. The Board has provided the Student with FAPE in the LRE in
the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years. (Findings ofFact 22, 24, 36).
