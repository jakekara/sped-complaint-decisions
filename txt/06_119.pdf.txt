 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  ISSUES:  1. Is the Student a student eligible for special education and related services as stated in 
The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1401 et seq 
and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a? 
 SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
:  The Student is a 3 years 11 months  young man who has not been identified as a Student 

requiring special education and is
 not entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education as defined in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and 
Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a.  The Student&#8482;s
 Parents rejected the Board&#8482;s denial of the 
Student&#8482;s ineligibility under IDEA.  On or about May 11, 2006 the Board received a letter 

advising them that the Parents were requesting a Due Process hearing.  
On or about May 10, 2006 an impartial special 
education Hearing Officer was appointed to hear 
the matter.  On or about May 24, 2006 a telephonic pre-hearing conference was held and hearing 

dates of June 26 and June 30, 20
06 were chosen by the parties. 
The parties instead of a resolution meeting went to
 mediation.  At mediation the parties reached 
an agreement in principle.  
The parties informed the Hearing Officer that the matter was settled and were withdrawing the 
matter with prejudice. 
The Final Decision and Order date was extended to
 accommodate the hearing dates and the filing 
of a decision. The date for the Final Decision and Order is August 11, 2006. 
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
 THE MATTER IS WITHDRAWN WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
