PRO CEDURAL HISTORY:

The Parents ﬁled the request for due process hearing on June 18, 2014. A preheating
conference was held on June 26, 2014, from which the issues listed above were
identiﬁed. At the prehearing conference, and later in a speciﬁc writing, the Parents asked
to extend the resolution period to allow the Parties to engage in mediation. There was no
obj ection from the Board and the request was granted. A due process hearing date was
set for August 26, 2014. Due to scheduling errors and then subsequent issues, the Parties
requested that the August 26, 2014 hearing date be re-scheduled and the ﬁnal decision
and order date be extended. The hearing date was moved to September 16, 2014, with
the subsequent ﬁnal decision and order date moved to October 1, 2014. Mediation was
scheduled and took place on August 14, 2014. The Parties reached agreement and
subsequently, the Parents withdrew their request for due process with prejudice.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The Parents have requested that this matter be withdrawn with prejudice. With no
further issues to be decided, this matter is DISMISSED with prejudice.
