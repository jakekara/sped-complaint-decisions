federal laws. CGS § 10—76, et seq. and the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Improvement Act ("IDEA") 20 U.S.C. § 1401, et seq.

2. IDEA opens the door of public education to children with disabilities. Board Qf'Educ.
fohe Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. u Rowley, 458 US. 176, 192 (1982). Under
IDEA, a local education agency (”LEA"), such as the Board, must provide to each
qualifying student a FAPE in the least restrictive environment, including special
education and related services. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(18).

3. A parent or a public agency may ﬁle a due process complaint on any of the matters
described in 34 C.F.R. §300.503(a)(1) and (2) (relating to the identification, evaluation 01'
educational placement ofa child with a disability, 01' the provision of FAPE to the child).
The due process complaint must allege a violation that occurred not more than two years
before the date the parent or public agency knew or should have known about the alleged
action that forms the basis ()l‘thc due process complaint, or, it‘the State has an explicit
time limitation for ﬁling a due process complaint under this part, in the time allowed by
that State law, except that the exceptions to the timeline described in §300.51 1(1) apply to
the timeline in this section. 34 C.F.R. §300.507.

4. The exercise ol‘judicial power depends upon the existence of a "case or controversy”
under the United States Constitution Article 111, Section 2. Dermis v. Odegaard, 416
U.S. 312, 316 (1974). The following factors are to be considered in determining whether
plaintiffs can meet the Constitutional requirements ot‘standing: 1. The plaintiff must
have suffered an injury in fact ~~ an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a)
concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;

2. There must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained 01'»
the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action ol‘the defendant and not the
result ot‘the independent action of some party not before the court; and 3. It must be
likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable
decision. Ltg‘an v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 US. 555, 560 (1992); Society Hill Towers
Owners’As.s"n v. Rendell, 210 F.3d 168, 176 (3d Cir. 2000). The Parent alleges an
invasion ofa legally protected interest ofthe Student in that the PPT of October 27, 201 1
had decided not to continue the Student’s placement at the Children’s Home (Finding of
Fact # 5), and that the new placement would not provide the Student with FAPE. This
would seem to create a “case or controversy" and give the Parent standing.

5‘ In addition to standing, plaintiffs "case 01‘ controversy" must be ripe for adjudication.
Artway v. Attorney General oflhe Stale Qf/V.J,, 81 F.3d 1235, 1246-47 (3d Cir. 1996).
"The basic rationale of the ‘t‘ipeness’ requirement is 'to prevent the courts, through the
avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract
disagreements."' Id. (quoting Abbott Labs v. Gardner, 387 US. 136, 148 (1967)). In its
leading case on ‘t'ipeness’, the Supreme Coutt held that determining whether a dispute is
ripe for review requires a two-pl‘onged analysis of (1) whether the issues presented to the
district court are fit for review, and (2) what hardship the patties will suffer in the
absence ofreview. See Abbott Labs. v. Gardner; 387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967), overruled

 

February 16, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0162

on other grounds, Ca/[ﬂmo v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (I977) Analyzing the ﬁrst prong of
the ‘t'ipeness’ inquiry, the matter is not ﬁt for review

6. The Student has been committed to the DCF under a FWSN (Findings of Fact #2) and
as a committed child it is DCF’s responsibility to provide placement for the child. A child
under a FWSN commitment is committed to the care and custody, but not the
guardianship, of the Commissioner of DCF for a period not to exceed eighteen (18)
months, for placement in foster care 01~ any licensed t'acility other than the Connecticut
Juvenile Training School (CJTS). FSWN cases are not voluntary in that the child is

under a court order to cooperate with the Depanment. Connecticut Degzarlmeni of

Children and Families Policy Manual Courts: 46—3-3 1, As the Student is a committed
child it is the responsibility of DCF to pay for the cost 0fthe placement. (Finding of Fact
# 4) As the Student is a committed child, the Board cannot change the placement of the
Student. Only DCF, with permission of the Court, can change the Student’s placement.
The Court has already denied DCF’s request to revoke cmmnitmenti (Finding of Fact #
6). The Parent’s request to maintain the Student’s placement at Children’s Home is not
ripe for review because the Board cannot place the Student at the Board’s school without
a revocation of commitment by the Court, There is no “case 01‘ controversy” since the
Board cannot enforce the piacement as recommended by the PPT. The Student continues
to be placed at Children’s Home under a FWSN commitment.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED.
