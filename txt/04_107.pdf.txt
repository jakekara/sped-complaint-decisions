Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  1. Whether the Board provided the Student a free appropriate public education 
during the 2003-2004 school year.  a. If not, whether the Intensive Education Academy (IEA) is an appropriate 
placement and program for the Student; and 
 2. Whether the Student is entitled to compensatory education for the 2002-2003 
school year for math lessons. 
 SUMMARY  The Parents claim they were concerned about the implementation of the Student&#8482;s 8
th grade program.  The Board denied their request for an independent monitor of the 
program and additional services that were 
provided by the Student&#8482;s previous special education teacher.  As a result of their concerns, the Parents unilaterally placed the Student in a segregated private school and seek reimbursement.
