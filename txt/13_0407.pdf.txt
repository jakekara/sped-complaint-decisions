sitting position using his arms and going to his side. His trunk strength is poor and when
sitting independently, he falls. (Testimony of Physical Therapist).

The Student demonstrates severe delays in receptive and expressive language skills and is
non-vcrbal. He communicates using facial expressions, gestures and reﬂexive noises. The
Student is unable to be formally tested with standardized assessments due to the severity
of his impairment. The Student has a left vocal paralysis and this would affect his speech.
(Testimony of Speech Therapist).

The Student has C01tical Visual Impairment (“CV1”). This is a neurological impairment
and relates to how the brain processes information. CV1 can cause fluctuation in visual
functioning and difﬁculty with getting around, recognizing objects, focusing on near
objects, have fast eye movements, and visual ﬁeld loss. Due to his CV1 diagnosis the
Student receives sewices from the Bureau of Education and Services for the Blind
(“BESB”). (B—50 and B—77).

The Student was diagnosed with hip dysplasia in both hips. This disability causes pain
and muscle spasms for which he received Valium as a muscle relaxant. This medication
causes drowsiness and makes the student sleepy. The Student underwent surgery for the
right hip dysplasia in 2008 and in January of 2013 for the left hip. The Student uses a
wheelchair to ambulate. The Student, in the future, should be able to stand independently.
The Student is also diagnosed with severe anoxic encephalopathy, a brain disease.
(Testimony of Student’s Pediatrician).

The Student has a hypoplastic left heait. This defect of the heart effects the pumping of
blood through the body. The Student’s oxygen saturation level is 80-84; the norm is 96—
100. This restriction of oxygen through the body affects the Student’s response.
(Testimony of Student’s Pediatrician).

The Mother has visited the Student’s classroom approximately one to two times per
week The Student likes to have things in his mouth. The Parent has observed the Student
in the classroom putting things in his mouth. She has observed the Student staring at a
monitor rather than having someone working with hint The Parent did not say anything
because she was timid. The Student did not allow himself to be touched. The Parent has
offered to go to school and work with the Student. (Testimony of Mother)

At the March 20, 2013 PPT meeting, the Mother expressed concerns regarding the use of 1
videos during class time, the communication between home and school, and the ‘
introduction of toilet training. (B—74).

 

The Mother asked the PPT for a change of placement. This was denied. The Parent has
not visited the out of district placement she has requested for the Student. (Testimony of
Mother).

color is ﬁne and to administer any medication he might need. (Testimony of School
Nurse).

The Student has signiﬁcant global delays with very limited physical abilities. He requires
maximum assistance with daily living skills. The Student is dependent upon adult
assistance to engage in academic activities. His lack of communication skills makes it
unclear if he is receiving academic skills presented. (B—70)‘

When the Student entered the Board’s school, he could track objects but only to midline,
He internally isolated things around him, did not cooperate. He would withdraw, rock,
shut his eyes 01' turn his head in avoidance. Due to his visual impairment he needed to
have things presented to his leﬁ side. He would place everything in his mouth. The
Student demonstrated difﬁculty in complying with hand over hand activities (Testimony
of Special Education Teacher)

The Student, until his January 2013 left hip dysplasia surgery, presented as being in
physical pain much ofthe time. He demonstrated facial grimacing and crying from the
pain. The classroom staff would change and alter his position. The change in position
would alleviate the pain. (Testimony of Special Education Teacher).

The Student’s daily schedule is composed ofbi'eakfast, morning circle time, sensory
activities and social interaction in the mainstream setting with non-disabled peers. After
lunch, the Student has free time where he is taken out of his wheelchair to do things and
lastly computer time as palt of his school day. (Testimony of Special Education Teacher).

The Student received special education instruction, occupational therapy, physical
therapy and speech and language pathology therapy. The Parent has enrolled the Student
in aquatic therapy. This has improved the Student’s trunk strength. (Testimony ol‘Special
Education Teacher and Parent).

The occupational therapist and the physical therapist develop and execute their own goals
and objectives for the Student. They provide in-service training to the school staff on how
to implement the plan. They provide direction to the classroom staffi (Testimony of
Special Education Teacher).

The Student is a non-verbal connnunicator. He uses reﬂexive language, facial
expressions and hand gestures to communicate. Prior to the left hip dysplasia surgery, the
student was distracted by the pain. The Student would nap during the day due to the
medication administration. This nap would last approximately 20 minutes. On occasions
the Student was in such deep sleep that he could not be awaken for therapy 11‘ therapy
was missed, the therapy time would be made up on another occasion. (Testimony 01‘
Speech Therapist).

The Student demonstrated satisfactory progress in his 201 1—2012 communication goal.
He did not master this goal because his response to auditow noises was inconsistent. The
Student required a full prompt hand—under— hand to move his hand. The fouith objective

of his communication goal was not introduced because the Student would get frustrated
trying to differentiate between a knock on the door and a horn. (Testimony of Speech
Therapist).

The Student was absent approximately 57 times during the 201 1—2012 school year.
School attendance is impoﬁant for consistency. (Testimony of Speech Therapist).

On May 5, 2012, the speech pathologist reevaluated the Student as part of his triennial
evaluation. The evaluator used a Functional Communication Profile to evaluate the
Student. The Student requires physical prompting to imitate motor movements. His
receptive language skills demonstrate limited understanding ofsingle words and phrases,
no desire to look at pictures and does not consistently respond to his name The Student
expressive language skills show evidence of attending to tasks when playing with a
musical switch and a pOp—up toy. The Student is a nonverbal communicatoxx He
inconsistently shows interest in others and activities. (B—66, Testimony of Speech
Therapist).

On May 14, 2012, the Student was evaluated by BESB. The evaluator recommended for
best visual functioning that the Student:
Have materials presented within 3 feet
Have preferential seating.
Use toys and materials that have good contrast.
Present one item at a time against contrasting backgrounds.
Use real items rather than symbols.
f. Use repetitive and familiar routines.
(B—60).

9999‘?”

The BESB evaluator also found that the Student does not have a hearing impairment. He
is a non—verbal communicator that requires hand—under—hand to complete all tasks. The
evaluator found that the Student is not afraid to try new things and can grasp and
manipulate a toy up to 5 seconds. He is able to localize a sound and respond to his name.
He enjoys interacting with adults and can distinguish between his classmates. The
Student receives consultative services from Teacher of Students with Visual Impairment
once a month. The evaluator recommended selvices by a certiﬁed Teacher of Students
with Visual Impairment 5 times a year. (B-60).

On May 22, 2012, the Student had a physical therapy evaluation. The evaluator found
that the Student had made progress in his tolerance for sitting in a wheelchair and for
change in his position throughout his school day. The Student had been provided with a
body brace because of an increased culvature and concern he was not able to sit straight,
The brace was not used in school because it did not ﬁt properly, seemed too tight and was
causing a breathing problem. (B—62 and Testimony of Physical Therapist).

At the June 2013 PPT meeting, the team recommended that the Student’s cardiologist
review the brace and make recommendations 01‘ adjustments with respect to its ﬁtting.
(Testimony of Mother).

The Student’s 201 1—2012 Progress Report showed that academically he had mastered
three objectives: track an object vertically; respond to sensory stimulation; and attend
auditory stimuli and respond with an appropriate gesture. The Student had made
satisfactory progress in two objectives and in one, grasps a pencil 0r crayon
conventionally, he had made no progress. (B—64).

The Student made satisfactory progress in his ﬁne/gross motor goal number 4. He was
able to master objective two: engage in activities using a variety of classroom tools with
maximum assistance and objective three: bring a utensil to his mouth with minimal
assistance. (B-64 and Testimony ol‘Occupational Therapist).

The Parent did not see the progress in the Student’s program. She has seen improvements
in the Student’s speech and he tries to pronounce “water”. The Mother did not voice her
opinion because she was timid and expected thing to improve. In March 2013 the Parent
obtained an advocate. (Testimony of Mother).

The Student’s 2012-2013 Individualized Education Program (lEP) consisted of ﬁve
goals:
a. An academic goal to improve his basic concepts and cognitive prerequisite skills
to learn and progress toward achieving the learning standard.
b. A social skills goal to improve social accepted behaviors in the school
environment.
c. A communication goal to improve language skills to listen to information to
improve understanding, expression and social interaction.
(1. A ﬁne motors skills goal to increase paiticipation in ﬁne/Visual motor and self~
care tasks.
e, A gross motor skills goal to improve strength, ﬂexibility and balance for
participation with the school program.
(B—71).

On October 23, 2012, the school nurse noticed that the Student’s eyes were red and
secreting some ﬂuid. The Student was sent home and she advised the Parent to take the
Student to his physician, The Student was diagnosed with conjunctivitis. The School
nurse was provided with a Seizure Action Plan, If the Student had a seizure the nurse was
to administer medication. The Student on January 7, 2013, undelwent surgery for the left
hip dysplasia. (Testimony of School Nurse and B—85).

The Student was absent from school following the surgery for leﬁ hip dysplasia until
April 8, 2013. Once the student was able to receive instruction, he was provided with
homebound tutoring following his surgery. The Parent was satisﬁed with the Student’s
home bound instruction. (Testimony of Mother).

Prior to his surgery, the Student had been making satisfactory progress in his 2012—20 13
goals and objects. The April marking period showed a lack ofprogress in all his goals

and objectives. This was due to the Student’s absence from school from January 7, 2013
to April 8, 2013. (Testimony of Special Education Teacher and B—79).

Since the surgery, the Student does not experience the debilitating pain he showed in
school. The Student’s attitude has changed since the surgery. He shows more interest in
school activities and those around him. He is more available to learn. The Student has
demonstrated playing by touching a ball suspended from the ceiling and other students
touching it back. (Testimony of Special Education Teacher).

The Student has shown progress in his ability to listen. He now responds to auditory
noises in a more consistent manner. The Student responds to color switches that are
musical. When the Student is asked, “Are you here?” He will independently press the
switch in response saying, “I am here.” If the Student’s motor skills improve, the speech
therapist may decide to add sign language or a variation of sign language to his program.
(Testimony of Speech Therapist).

Before, the Student would place a toy in his mouth, now, he uses it in an intentional
manner. (Testimony of Special Education Teacher).

The conmiunication log is used to inform the Parent of the Student’s progress and what
he is doing in school. With this information, the Parent could work at home with these
skills. The Parent did not respond to the communication log because she was not aware
that she should. The Parent stated that she follows the communication Iog’s
recommendations. (Testimony of Speech Therapist).

The initiation ofa toileting protocol was a concern of the Mother. This protocol was
considered by the occupational therapist and she discussed it with the private therapist
from Yale. The Yale therapist said the Parent had not expressed this concern but needed a
note from the Student’s doctor, that he had the readiness skills for this protocol and the
sensation necessary to indicate a need to use the toilet. Neither the Student’s doctor nor
the private occupational therapist has recommended the initiation of a toileting program.
The Mother has not spoken with the school nurse about a toileting program. (Testimony
ol‘Oceupalional Therapist and Mother).

Initiating a transfer of the Student from his wheel chair to a change table required two
persons. Since the Student’s January 2013 operation this now can be accomplished by
one person with the assistance of the Student. The Student is now able to bear some of his
own weight. (Testimony of Occupational Therapist).

The Mother has not visited the school 01' program that is being recommended for the
Student. She was given a note telling her what is available at ACES. They have a
swimming program and they utilize music. (Testimony of Mother).

August 22, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0407

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW and ARGUMENT:

1.

It is undisputed that the Student is eligible for special education and related services as
set forth in IDEA, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401, et seq. FAPE is deﬁned as specia1 education and
related sewices that are provided at public expense, meet the standards of the state
educational agency, include an appropriate school education, and that are provided in
conformity with the IEP. 20 U.S.C. §1401(8).

Once a Board has identiﬁed a child as eligible for IDEA sewices, it must create and
implement an IEP based on the student‘s needs and areas of disability. Boards are not,
however, required to “maximize the potential” of each handicapped student. Bd. of Educ.
Of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. V. Rowlev, 458 US. 176, 197 n. 21 (1982)).
Instead, to satisfy the IDEA, the Board must offer an IEP that is “reasonably calculated”
to enable the child to receive “meaningful” educational beneﬁts in light of the student‘s
intellectual potential. ﬁat 206-207. Once the Board has designed and administered an
IEP that is reasonably calculated to enable the receipt of meaningful educational beneﬁts,
it has satisﬁed its obligation to provide the child with FAPE.

If the Parent or the Student is not satisﬁed 01' that the program will not provide FAPE,
they can challenge the educational placement. 34 C.F.R. §300.507(a)(1). It is the Board’s
responsibility of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the appropriateness 01" the
program and p1acement it has provided to the Student. Conn. Gen. Stat. (CGS) §10—76h—
14(a).

The standard for determining whether a Board has provided a free appropriate public
education is set forth as a two-palt inquiry in Rowley. It must first be determined whether
the Board c0111p1ied with the procedural requirements of IDEA. The second inquiry is a
determination 01" whether the IEP is “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive
educational beneﬁts.” 1_d. at 206-207.

The IDEA’s procedural requirements and safeguards are designed to assure that the
parents ofa child with a disability have a fu11 and meaningful oppmtunity to paiticipate
a1ong with LEA personnel in developing, reviewing and revising their child’s IEP.
Compliance with the IDEA’s procedural requirements is the responsibility of the Board
and not the Parents. Uniﬁed Sch. Dist. v. Dept. of Ed., 64 Com). App. 273, 285 (2001).
Procedural Violations alone can be deemed a denial of F APE. Student v. Newtown
B.O.E. CT DOE Case No. 07—075 (8/23/07). In order to conclude that procedural
violations resulted in a denial of a FAPE, the Parents must show that the procedura1
errors resulted in a loss of educational oppomlnity. E. at 22; See, Burke County Bd. of
Ed. v. Denton, 895 F.2d 973, 982 (41" Cir. 1999); Evans v. District No. 17 841 F.2d 824,
830 (8th Cir. 19882; W.G. v. Bd. of Trustees of Target Range Sch. Dist. N0. 23, 960 F.2d
1479, 1484—85 (9l Cir. 1992). When a procedural Violation is alleged, a Hearing Ofﬁcer
may ﬁnd that a Student did not receive FAPE it‘ the procedural inadequacies impeded the
child’s right to FAPE, signiﬁcantly impeded the Parents’ oppommity to participate in the
decision—making process regarding the provision of a F APE t0 the Parents’ child, or
caused a deprivation ot‘educational beneﬁt. 34 CFR §300.513(a) (2) (i—iii); Ld. at 22; See,

 

 

 

August 22, 2013 Final Decision and Order 1320407

Burke at 982; Evans at 830; W.G. at 1484-8. Procedural violations that interfere with
Parents' participation in the IEP formulation process undermine the very essence of
IDEA. Amanda J. ex rel Annette J. v. Clark County Sch. Dist, 267 F.3d 877 (9"‘ Cir.
200] ). An IEP addresses the unique needs of the child and cannot be developed if those
people most familiar with the child’s needs are not involved or fully informed. Q
Procedural safeguards are set fonh in 20 U.S.C. §l415 and 34 CFR §§500-536 and
include: the right for Parents to patticipate in all meetings (CFR §300.50] (b); the right
for Parental involvement in placement decisions (CF R §300.501 ((1)); the right ot’Parents
to examine all educational records (CFR §300.501(a)); the right for Parents to obtain an
Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE) of their child (§300.502(b); the requirement
for Boards to consider evaluations provided by Parents at private expense in the deciding
FAPE (CRF §300.502(c)). IDEA expects strong Parental input at PPT meetings, Warren
G.vtCumbe1‘land County Sch. Dist., 190 F. 3d 80, 86 (3d Cir. 1993). The IEP is to
be collaborative developed by the Parents of the Student, educators and other specialists
and Congress repeatedly emphasized the “impoﬁance and indeed the necessity of
Parental participation in both the development of the IEP and any subsequent
assessments.” Honig V. Doe 484 US. 305, 3l 1 (1988). Failure by the Board to develop
an IEP in accordance with procedures mandated by IDEIA, in and of itself, can be
deemed a denial of FAPET Amanda J. ex rel Annette J . v. Clark County Sch.Dist.. 267
F.3d 877 (9“‘ Ci1'.2001).

6. There are no allegations that the Board committed any procedural Violations and the
testimony provided does not demonstrate that Board failed to provide the Parent her
procedural safeguards. She was a given the opportunity to be a meaningful palticipant at
the PPT. (F indings of Fact N0. 8).

7. The second inquiry of the Rowley test speciﬁcally addresses whether the respective
Student’s IEP provided FAPE. Appropriateness is determined by focusing on what was
or was not, objectively reasonable when a snapshot of the IEP was taken. DP. and DP.
on behalt‘ofNF. V. Rampo Central School District, 403 F3d. 595 (2d. Circuit 2005).

8. The Board fulﬁlls its obligation under the second inquiry if it provides an IEP that is
“likely to produce progress, not regression,” and if the LEP affords the Student with an
opportunity greater than “trivial advancement.” Walczak v. Florida Union Free School
District, 142 F.3d at 130.

9. The Student’s 2012—2013 program was in the LRE. This mandate requires: (i) To the
maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public 01'
private institutions 01‘ other care facilities, are educated with children who are
nondisabled; and (ii) Special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children
with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only il‘the nature or
severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of
supplementary aids and sewices cannot be achieved satisfactorily. 34C.F.R.
§300.l 14(a)(2).

The Student’s program provided time for him to be in a classroom with non—disabled
peers. (Findings of Fact N0, 14).

The Student was making satisfactory progress in his 1151’ goals and objectives for the
November and January marking periods. This progress came to an abrupt reversal in his
April marking period. (Findings 01‘ Fact N0. 31).

Student’s lack of progress during the April marking period of the 2012—2013 school year
does not demonstrate that the Board failed to offer a program reasonably calculated to
offer meaningful educational beneﬁt. In Lessard v. Wilton—Lyndeborough Cooperative
School District 49 IDELR 180, 518 F.3d 18, 29 (lst Cir. 2008), the coult ruled that
limited progress after implementation of the IEP does not render an IEP inappropriate.
While educational progress can demonstrate that an lEP provides FAPE, the lack 01‘ to
progress does not mean that the IEP was not appropriate:
But to impose the inverse of this 11116: — that a lack of progress necessarily
betokens an IEP’s inadequacy — would contradict the fundamental concept
that an IEP is a snapshot, not a retrospective. Where, as here, a school
system develops an IEP component in reliance upon a widely—accepted
methodology, an inquiring court ought not to condemn that methodology
ex post merely because the disabled child’s progress does not meet the
parents’ or the educators’ expectations. (internal citations omitted).
1n holding that the district’s IEP offered the Student FAPE, the cou1t noted that “levels of
progress must be judged with respect to the potential of the particular child.” See also
Fuhi'maim v. East Hanover Board of Education]. 19 IDELR 1065 (3rd Cir. 1993)

 

The Student’s capabilities, intellectual progress and what the LEA has offered must be
considered along with grade promotions and test scores in determining whether the
program offered is reasonably calculated to confer a nontrivial 0r meaningful educational
benefit to the child. See, e.g. ﬂail; 774 F.2d at 635.

The Student’s potential is extremely limited by the multiple disabilities that affect all
facets of his life skills. (Findings of Fact No. 2—8). Accomplishments that are normally
taken for granted, responding to auditory noises, are a challenge for the Student.

(F indings of Fact No. 18) Ifanything spoke of the Student’s condition was the facial
expressions and crying from the pain he was enduring from the hip dysplasia. I-lis lack of
communication skills made it unclear if he was receiving the academic skills presented.
(Findings ofFact N0. 1 l and 13). His progress in his goals and objectives, prior to his
January 2013 operation, was satisfactory and all indications since his return to school in
April 8, 2013 indicate that he will continue making progress. The Student demonstrates
playing by touching a ball, he responds to color switches that are musical, he uses toys as
they are intended and doesn’t place them in his mouth. The Student independently
presses the colored switch to state he is present. (Findings of Fact No. 32—34). There is no
evidence that the progress of the IEP’s goals and objectives being shown will not
continue.

To the extent a procedural claim raised by the Parent is not speciﬁcally addressed herein,
the Hearing Ofﬁcer has concluded that the claim lacked merit.

.FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
1. The program offered by the Board for the 2012—2013 school is appropriate and does
provide the Student with a FAPE in the LRE.
2. The second issue of whether the program at ACES is appropriate is moot based on the

ﬁnding that the Board’s program was appropriate. Also the evidence provided did not
demonstrate what the ACES program offered the Student
