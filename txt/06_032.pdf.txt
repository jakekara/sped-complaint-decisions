       One Constitution Plaza 
Hartford, CT 06103  Appearing before: Attorney Deborah R. Kearns, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 ISSUES  I. Whether the local educational agency failed to meet its obligations 
pursuant to Child Find in February 2004? 
II. Whether the local education agency provided the child a free and appropriate public education for the 2005-2006 school year? 
III. If the IEP provided by the local educational agency for 2005-2006 school 

year was not appropriate, was the parent&#8482;s unilateral placement at the 

Rectory School appropriate? 
IV. Whether the child is entitled to 
compensatory education services? 
   PROCEDURE    The parent moved to include issues for hearing beyond the scope of the two year statute of limitation claiming they had not
 received the copies of the procedural 
safeguards when the child was exited from special education in 1999.  The parties submitted testimony and evidence and the request to extend the statute of  
limitation was denied. The parties agreed to submit a joint statement as follows 

(HO-1) (1) Whether the Board&#8482;s failure to address the Owens&#8482; ADD results in February 
2004, constituted a failure to meet the Child Find requirements and 

consequently, a denial of FAPE?  
(2) Whether the Board provided the student a free and appropriate public 
education (FAPE) the 2005-2006 school year?
