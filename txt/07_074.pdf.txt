2007 school year and requested placement of 
the student at the Foundation School. On or about March 21, 2007, the Parent sent the Board a letter advising them that they were 

requesting a due process hearing.   On or about March 21, 2007 a pre-hearing conference was held and a May 16, 2007 hearing date was chosen by the parties. On May 8, 2007, the parties mediated the matter 
and requested additional time to try and reso
lve the issues.  The parties requested a 
cancellation of the hearing date. The request was granted and additional hearing dates of 

June 13 & 21, 2007 were chosen by the parties. The parties continued mediating the 
matter and requested again cancellation of the 
hearing dates as they had an agreement in 
principal and needed additional time to finish the agreement.

sent an e-mail to the hearing 
officer withdrawing with prej
udice the Parent&#8482;s request for 
due process. The request for withdrawal with prejudice of the due process hearing was granted.
