On November 5, 2015, the Student reported that the pa1ties had palticipated in mediation and
agreed that a Planning and Placement Team (“PPT”) meeting would be conducted to review
an evaluation conducted by The McCarton Center. The parties further agreed to conduct that
PPT meeting on the day scheduled for the evidentiary hearing in this case, November 19,
2015. Accordingly, the Student requested postponement of the November 19, 2015 hearing as
well as a postponement and extension of the timelines to conduct the hearing and ﬁle the ﬁnal
decision. The hearing date of November 19, 2015 was cancelled and the timelines were
extended.

On December 22, 2015, a second Prehearing Conference was conducted. The palties repolted
that the PPT was then scheduled to take place on January 13, 2016. On December 22, 2015,
the Student requested an additional 30—day extension of the timelines to allow the parties an
oppottunity t0 paltieipate in the planned PPT meeting and to thereby narrow and/or adjust the
issues for the case or eliminate the need for a hearing. The Board consented to the request and
it was granted, establishing the new deadline as J anuary 29, 2016.

On January 15, 2016, the Student reported that the parties had participated in the PPT but had
not resolved the conﬂict. The Student further reported that the Student would seek
amendment of the request for due process to include additional matters of conﬂict between the
panties. The Student therefore requested an additional 30-day extension of the timelines to
conduct the hearing and issue the ﬁnal decision to allow the Student an opportunity to seek
amendment of the request for due process. The request was not opposed and it was granted.

On February 20, 2016, the Student requested yet another extension of time to complete the
process of seeking to amend the request for due process to March 25, 2016. The Board did
not object and the request was granted. On February 27, 2016, the Student ﬁled a proposed
Amended Complaint. On March 3, 2016, Attorney Marsha Moses appeared on behalf of the
Stamford Board of Education in place of Attorney Christopher Tracey. On March 15, 2016,
the Board of Education reported that it did not obj ect t0 amendment of the complaint and the
amendment was accepted and the deadline for ﬁling the ﬁnal decision was reset to May 12,
2016.

A third Prehearing Conference was conducted on April 7, 2016 to adjust the issues for the
case and select a hearing date. A hearing date of June 23, 2016 was selected. On May 3,
2016, the Student requested another thirty-day postponement and extension of the deadline to
conduct the hearing and issue the ﬁnal decision to June 10, 2016. The purpose of the request
was to accommodate the hearing schedule and afford the parties due process. The Board of
Education did not object to the request and it was granted.

On June 6, 2016, the Student requested another thirty-day postponement and extension of the
timelines to conduct the hearing and issue the ﬁnal decision to Friday July 8, 2016. The
purpose of the request was again to accommodate the hearing schedule and afford the parties
due process. The Board of Education did not object to the request and it was granted,

On June 23, 2016, an evidentiary hearing was convened. Neither the Student nor the Board of
Education appeared at the scheduled hearing. A telephonic conference was conducted. The
panties reported that they were again attempting to schedule a mediation of the case. The
Student requested, and the Board of Education consented to, further postponements and

that they could pm‘sue settlement discussions. The request was granted and hearings were
scheduled for August 25, 2016 and August 31, 2016. On August 22, 2016, the parties
reported that they were ﬁnalizing a settlement agreement and requested that the hearing of
August 25 , 2016 be cancelled. The request was granted.
