      FINAL DECISION  
 These cases involved siblings and began as separate matters 
assigned to separate hearing officers.  Both prehearing conferences were conducted on December 4, 2006 and the 
parties advised that they would be pursuing mediation and seeking an Order to 
Consolidate the two cases into 
one hearing process.  A hearing date was set for January 12, 2007 by agreement of the parties in the 06
-328 matter and for January 17, 2007 in the 
06-329 matter.  These dates were selected to 
allow the parties time to mediate the matter. 
The Parents filed a Motion to Consolidate which was not opposed by the Board and was granted.  The department later reported that
 the parties had resolved the matter in 
mediation.  
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
  The hearing is dismissed.
