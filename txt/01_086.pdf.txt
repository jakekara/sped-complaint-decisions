May 14, 2001 -2- Final Decision and Order 01-086  BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL MATTERS:   1. The Parents&#8482; attorney requested this 
expedited hearing on March 29, 2001.  A Hearing Officer was assigned to the case.  She offered to recuse herself at the request of either party because she has a child who attends the Board&#8482;s middle school.  The Board&#8482;s attorney 
requested that she disqualify herself.   Thereafter, this Hearing Officer was assigned to the 
case on April 2, 2001.  A prehearing conference was thereafter held on April 10, 2001.  Two hearing dates were scheduled for April 17 and May 3, 2001.    2. Parties were given until April 16 to file exhibits
 and witness lists.  Initially the Board filed its 
list of witnesses and no exhibits.  The Parents filed their witness list and 15 exhibits.  At the first day of the hearing on April 17, 2001, the Parents requested the opportunity to review the student&#8482;s records, which they claimed were
 withheld.  The Board denied receiving any request for the records, but at the request of the Hearing Officer agreed to make the records 
available for the Parents&#8482; attorney to examine during the lunch recess.  The Hearing Officer 
marked the request for hearing as Hearing O
fficer Exhibit 1 and requested the Board to provide a copy of the student&#8482;s Individual Education Program (IEP) which was in effect on 
March 7, which it then offered as Board Exhibit 1.  Both parties later filed supplemental 
exhibits, two for the Board and eight for the Parents.  The Parents&#8482; attorney filed a Final 
Index of Parents Exhibits at the May 3 hearing.  3. An additional date was added on April 26 in or
der for the parties to complete the hearing 
within the requisite 45 days.  On April 18, the Parents&#8482; attorney sent a letter to the Hearing Officer in which he stated, among other things, 
that the Parents would assert that the Board failed to comply with the written notice 
requirements of 34 C.F.R. Section 300.503 and 
Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies Section 10-7[6]d-8.    4. On April 26, the parties were heard on the Boar
d&#8482;s objection to the addition of the Parents&#8482; procedural claim and the Board&#8482;s claim that 
the Parent (mother) signed a waiver of written 
notice at the March 12 manifestation determ
ination review PPT.  That document was 
received as Parent Exhibit 20 and the issue was reserved for adjudication in the final decision.  5. The Parent (mother) was permitted, over the Bo
ard&#8482;s objection, to offer testimony as to the 
circumstances surrounding her signing Parent Exhibit 20 for purposes of presenting the 
Parents&#8482; claim that there was no informed cons
ent or waiver of written prior notice.  The 
Board offered rebuttal testimony of this issue in its case on May 3. 
   6. The Parents&#8482; medical expert, Douglas Ber
v, M.D., was on vacation and not available on April 26, but the parties were accommodated by 
starting the hearing at 9:30 am on May 3 
and allowing the remainder of the day for the Bo
ard&#8482;s presentation of its case.  All witnesses 
were heard and the parties were allowed oral closing argument on May 3, as well as the 
opportunity to file written briefs by May 11.  Both parties filed written submissions.  The 
parties have had a full and ample opportunity to present all their evidence, both written and 
oral testimony, as well as legal arguments.
