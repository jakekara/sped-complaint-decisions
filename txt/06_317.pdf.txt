  FINAL ORDER AND DECISION  SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
:  The Student is a 12 years old young boy who has been identified as Other Health Impaired ADD/ADHD and is entitled to receiv
e a free and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in Individuals with Disabilities E
ducation Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a.  At the October 25, 2006 PPT meeting, the Parents rejected the program 
offered by the Board for the 2006-2007 school year.  On or about November 2, 2006, the Board received notice of the Parents&#8482; request 
for due process. Mediation was held on December 13, 2006.  An impartial hearing officer 
was appointed on November 2, 2006 and a pre-hearing conference was held on November 17, 2006.  A hearing date of Dece
mber 20, 2006 was chosen by the parties. 
In a letter dated November 13, 
2006, the Board&#8482;s attorney contested the sufficiency of the Parents due process request.  At the pre-hearing conference, 
the Parents agreed to rectify their due process request.  On or about November 27, 2006, the hearing officer requested 
that the Parents comply with the request for 
a more sufficient due process request.  On or about December 12, 2006, the Board filed a Motion to Dismiss based on the Parents lack of compliance with the clarificat
ion of the due process request.
