FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Does the Middletown Board of Education’s proposed Individualized Education
Program (“IEP”) and placement provide the Student a free and appropriate public
education (“F APE”) in the least restrictive environment (“LRE”)?

2. If the answer to Issue No. 1 is no, what is the appropriate remedy?

PRO CEDURAL HISTORY:

The hearing was requested on August 21, 2013 (by agreement of the parties) and the
mailing date for the ﬁnal decision and order was October 25, 20134 A resolution meeting
was not held as the parties agreed to participate in mediation on September 6, 2013. The
initial Due Process hearing was scheduled for September 17, 2013. The Parties were
successful in mediation and requested to continue the scheduled hearing date on
September 17, 2013 to allow for the parties to formalize the agreement and to allow (at
that time) the self-represented Parent to seek legal advice. Subsequently, Counsel for the
Parent ﬁled an appearance and represented that agreement had been reached and the
matter was being withdrawn with prejudice by the Parent.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The Parties, through Counsel, stated that they had reached agreement through the use of
mediation. Counsel for the Parent subsequently withdrew the complaint, with prejudice.
Given that there are no further issues in this matter, the hearing is DISMISSED with

prejudice.
