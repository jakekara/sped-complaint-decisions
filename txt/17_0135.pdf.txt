FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Was the triennial evaluations performed by the Board on May 2016 appropriate? If not;
2. Is the Student entitled to an independent evaluation at public expense?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Other Health Impaired ADD/ADHD and is entitled to
receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act
(IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning
and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the triennial psychological evaluations
performed by the Board on May 2016. The Parents requested an independent evaluation. The
Board refused the Parents’ request and ﬁled for due process. The parties attempted to mediate the
matter.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on September 13, 2016, and a pre-hearing conference
was held on September 22, 2016. Hearing dates of October 28, 2016 and November 14, 2016
were chosen by the parties. At the November 14, 2016, hearing date, the Board offered to
conduct the independent evaluation. The Parents accepted the Board’s offer to conduct the
triennial psychological evaluation at public expense. The Board withdrew their request for due
process with prejudice.

The date for the mailing of the F inal Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the
hearing dates. The mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is December 7, 2016.
