PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student requested a special education due process hearing in the above—captioned matter on May 28,
2015. The Impaitial Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed to hear the case on May 28, 2015. After a few
unsuccessful effoﬁs, a telephonic pre—hearing conference was ﬁnally held on July 20, 2015. Attorney
Michelle Laubin appeared on behalf of the Board of Education and Attorney Terry Bedard appeared on
behalf of the Student. At that time, the deadline for ﬁling the ﬁnal decision and order was established to
be August 12, 2015. An evidentiary hearing was scheduled for September 8, 2015.

On J uly 26, 2015 , the Student moved to amend the complaint and submitted a proposed amended
request for special education due process hearing. The Board of Education did not object to the
requested amendment, and it was allowed. The amendment reset the deadline for ﬁling the ﬁnal
decision and order to October 10, 2015. On August 24, 2015, the Student reported that the parties had
ﬁnally resolved their dispute, and requested that the case be dismissed.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

It is ordered that the Student’s request for dismissal is granted and this matter is dismissed.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state 01' federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
