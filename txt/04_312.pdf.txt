On October 26, the Hearing Officer wrote to the parties regarding whether they intended to proceed with the hearing on November 9 and, if so, that they should file their witness lists and exhibits on or before November 2.  On November 1, the Board's attorney wrote to the Hearing Officer that the parties had agreed on a settlement in principle and were working on the exact language of the Agreement.
