FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
Via Request for Impartial Special Education Hearing dated November 3, 2009, Student filed a request 
for due process hearing. The request for hearing was received by the Board of Education on November 3, 2009. The 30-day resolution period ran through Decembe
r 3, 2009.  The deadline for mailing the final 
decision and order is January 17, 2010. On November 6, 2009, the Student indicated to the Hear
ing Officer that she would like the hearing to be put on hold pending a meeting with the Board of Edu
cation and that she may then
 withdraw the case. She made similar requests on November 11, 2009 and November 23, 2009. 
On November 29, 2009, the case was s
till pending and the Hearing Officer issued a notice of pre-hearing conference for December 8, 2009. Via letter date
d December 4, 2009, the Board of Education filed a 
sufficiency challenge claiming that the request for hear
ing &#64257;does not include a sufficient description of the nature of or facts relating to the disagreement the parents have with th
e program proposed by the Board and it 
also lacks a proposed resolution.&#64258; The Student did not file a response to the Board&#8482;s sufficiency challenge. The parties participated in a pre-hearing conference on December 8, 2009 at which time the Student 
was asked to clarify the issues and the parties were given an opportunity to address the sufficiency challenge. During the pre-hearing conference, the 
Student raised the following issues: 1. Is the consultant independent? 2. Was the Parent&#8482;s voice heard in the IEP process? 
3. Is the Student getting the hours of support as required by the IEP? 4. Is the IEP appropriate? 5. Should the Board of Education be required to pay for an evaluation of Student? 6. Did the Board of Education prevent inclusion? 7. Is the Student entitled to compensatory education? 
8. Should the Board of Education provide equipment for Student, including hearing aids?
