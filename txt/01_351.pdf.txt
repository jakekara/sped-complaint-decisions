         FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  ISSUES:  1. Did the Wilton Board of Education (hereinafter
 the Board) provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (hereinafter FAPE) for the 2001-2002 school year; and  2. If not, is a residential placement appropriate for the Student to receive FAPE? 
 SUMMARY:  The Student, eleven years old during most 
of the 2001-2002 school year during which this hearing took place, is a boy identified as having autism.  Until he was seven he lived overseas in 
Italy where he received no educational program.  He is severely delayed in many areas.  His 
parents requested due process after their request for a residential placement for their son was 
refused by the Board which believes the Student is receiving a significant educational benefit in their program.
