 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  
 SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
:  The Student is a young man who has not been 
identified as a student requiring special education and related services and is not entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a.  The Parent filed a request for due process requesting homebound services.  

 
An impartial hearing officer was appoin
ted on October 10, 2008 and a pre-hearing 
conference was scheduled for October 28, 2008.  The hearing officer requested copies of the last 2 PPT&#8482;s and the last evaluation of th
e Student prior to the pre hearing conference.  
These were not provided to the hearing officer since there had not been a PPT meeting 
held for the Student nor had the Board performed any evaluations of the Student.  
 
An attempt was made by the hearing officer 
to conduct the pre hearing conference.  The Parent informed the hearing officer that she ha
d filed a complaint with the Office of Civil 
Rights of the United States Department of Education (&#64257;OCR&#64258;) and that she could not have a due process hearing on the same issues
 while an OCR complaint was in process.  
The Parent at this time would not part
icipate in the pre hearing conference.
  The Board on or about November 7, 2008 file
d a Motion to Dismiss the due process 
complaint based on the Student not residing 
in the school district and therefore the hearing officer lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
