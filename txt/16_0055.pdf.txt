FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Is the Student eligible for special education and related services as deﬁned in the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Aet(1DEA)? If so;

2. Was the program provided by the Board for the 2014-2015 school year appropriate and did it
provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE)?

3. Is the program provided by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year appropriate and does it provide
the Student with FAPE in the LRE? If not;

4. Should the Board place the Student at the Easton Country Day School in Easton, CT for the 2015—
2016 school year at public expense?

5. Is the Student entitled to Compensatory Education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has not been identiﬁed as eligible to receive FAPE as deﬁned in IDEA 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq.
and Connecticut General Statutes §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the
Parents rejected the determination that the Student was not eligible for special education and related
services and requested the Student be identiﬁed as eligibIe and placed at Easton Country Day School for
the 2015-2016 school year; the Board refused the Parents’ request. On July 23, 2015, the Board received
notice of the Parents’ request for due process. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on July 24, 2015
and a pre—hearing conference was held on August 4, 2015. The parties agreed to mediation in place of a
resolution meeting. The mediation session was held on September 15, 2015.

In an electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties were able to
resolve the issues but required additiona1 time to memorialize the agreement. In an electronic transmission
dated October 22, 2015, the Parents’ attorney withdrew the matter with prej udice. There was no objection
by the Board; the withdrawal was granted. The mailing date for the Final Decision and Order was extended
to November 5, 2015 to accommodate the parties’ mediation.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiling special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the healing ofﬁcer Within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereqf, the State Board of Educatibn shall take appropriate action to enforce the

ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing officer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the healing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
com“: by either party in accordance With the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415 (i)(2)(A).
