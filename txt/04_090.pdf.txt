August 17, 2004 -1- Final Decision and Order 04-090  STATE OF CONNECTICUT  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION    Norwich Board of Education  v.  Student  Appearing on behalf of the Board of Education:  Attorney Linda L. Yoder              Shipman & Goodwin LLP              One Constitution Plaza                Hartford, CT  06103-1919  Appearing on behalf of the parent:         pro se  Appearing before:           Attorney Deborah R. Kearns         Hearing Officer  ISSUE:  Whether the local educational agency (LEA) can without the parent&#8482;s consent release school records to an evaluator the parties have agreed will conduct a risk assessment and a psychiatric evaluation, for a child with disabilities to whom the LEA provides specialized instructions and related services?  PROCEDURAL  HISTORY:    The hearing was requested by the board of education. Requests for extensions to permit scheduling of hearing dates were granted.  On the first day of hearing, the parent wanted an additional continuance to retain counsel.  The board opposed a delay.  After a break the parent decided she was prepared to proceed on the very limited issue for hearing. The parties agreed to provide post-hearing briefs to each other and to the hearing officer.  The board did not receive a copy of the parent&#8482;s post-hearing brief.  They requested an extension to allow time to respond to the parent&#8482;s post-hearing brief.  The record closed July 22, 2004, the date the board confirmed it would not be issuing a response to the parent&#8482;s post-hearing brief.  The parent&#8482;s additional issues for hearing are distinct from the limited issues the LEA claims in its request for due process. The parties agreed at the outset of the hearing they were prepared to proceed on the limited issues in the LEA&#8482;s &#64257;Request for Impartial Education Hearing&#64258;.  The parent will decide if she will proceed with other issues at a later date.  SUMMARY OF THE FACTS:  The local educational agency (LEA) claims follow:  The child was excluded from the LEA school effective October 15, 2003 for making a statement that violated the schools policy prohibiting threatening language.
