 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  (May 6, 2008)  
BACKGROUND  This matter was commenced by request for 
due process dated April 8, 2008.  That request states that the Student disagrees with a manifestati
on determination made at an 
IEP team meeting on April 3, 2008 determini
ng that conduct for which he was being subject to disciplinary action was not a manifesta
tion of his disability.   It is unclear from the documentation whether this matter was commenced by the Student (who appears to 

be over 18 years of age) on his own behalf or by the Student&#8482;s father. The undersigned 
was appointed as hearing officer on April 11, 2008.  
On April 15, 2008, the Hearing Officer was notified that the parties had agreed to participate in a Department-sponsored medi
ation scheduled to take place on April 16, 
2008.   On April 21, 2008, the Hearing Officer contacted both Ms. Epps and the 
identified representative of the Student to ascertain whether this matter had been resolved 
through the mediation.  Ms. Epps
&#8482; assistant advised that the Board was not represented by counsel and that it was her understanding that the parties had resolved the dispute but that Ms. Epps was out of town for the week.    
On April 25, 2008, the Hearing Officer issued a notice of pre-hearing conference (the &#64257;Notice&#64258;) directing that unless the parties reported to him by or before April 30, 2008 that this matter had been resolved, a 
telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) would convene on May 2, 2008 to determine 
whether a hearing was necessary and 
establish a schedule for hearing if necessary.
