FmAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1 . Was there any delay in the provision of special education services for the Student
when the Student moved into the Board’s school district, for which the Board was
responsible, and which delay resulted in a denial of a free appropriate public
education (FAPE)?

2. if there was a denial of FAPB, what shall be the remedy?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This hearing was requested by the Student’s Surrogate Parent on January 17, 201 1 and
the Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on February 7, 201 1. A resolution meeting was held
on Febmary 15, 201 1‘ The date for mailing the decision was April 2, 201 1.

A pre-hearing conference was held on March 4, 201 1. The hearing was scheduled for
April 13, 201 1, and the Patties requested an extension of the decision date to
accommodate the hearing date. The request was granted, and the decision date was
extended to May 2, 201 1. The hearing convened and was completed on April 13, 201 1.

A11 motions and objections not previously mled upon, if any, are hereby ovcrmied.

SUMMARY:

The Student is identiﬁed as having multiple disabilities, among which are visual
impairment and intellectual impairment. He had been living in a group home and
attending school in a program provided by Oak Hill School. In anticipation ofhis 21‘I
birthday, he was moved to another group home in a different school district, and that

school district was notiﬁed ofhis possible arrival.

 

April 28, 201 1 Final Decision and Order 11-0239

A1though an initial meeting about his move involving several agencies was held, there
was a gap of approximately fomteen schooi days between the Student’s move into the
school district and his actual enrollment in the School District’s program. His Surrogate
Parent initiated a hearing, claiming a denial of FAPE due to this delay. The Board
responded that they could not em'011 him safely until they received a fuli Individualized
Education Program (IEP) from his prior school placement with suppelting
documentation, held a Planning and Placement Team (PPT) meeting, and revised his IBP.

Although this hearing was limited to the issues concerning Student’s delayed enrollment
in the Board’s program, his 1/25/2010 IEP is described to illustrate details of his prior
program. The Board’s 12/23/2010 and 2/24/2011 IEPs are described as sources for the

award of compensatory education.

In order to comply with the conﬁdentiality requirements of the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. § 12323! and related regulations at 34 C.F.R. §
99, the following decision uses “Student”, “School”, “Parent" and titles of school staff
members and other witnesses in place of names and other personally identiﬁable
information. The name of the school district is also omitted because the Student’s unique
history, with the name of the town, could reveal his identity.

This Final Decision and Order sets faith the Hearing Ofﬁcer’s summary, ﬁndings of fact
tmd conclusions of law. The ﬁndings of fact and conclusions of law set forth herein,
which reference certain exhibits and witness testimony, are not meant to exclude other
supponed evidence on the record. T0 the extent that the procedural history, summary,
and ﬁndings of fact actually represent conclusions of 1aw, they should be so considered,
and vice versa. For reference, see SAS Instllure Inc, v. H Compuler Systems, Inc, 605
F.Supp. 816 (M.D. Tenn. 1985) and Bonnie Ann F. v. Calallen Independent School
Dislrlcl, 835 F.Supp. 340,201DELR 736 (SD. Tex. 1993). '

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:

Section 10-7611, Connecticut General Statutes (0.0.8.), and related regulations at Section
10-7611, Regulations of Comiectieut State Agencies (R.C.S.A.), authorize an impartial
hearing ofﬁcer to conduct a special education hearing and to render a final decision in
accordance with Sections 4-176e through 4-180a, inclusive, and Sections 4-181a of the
C.G.S. Section 20 U.S.C. § 1415(1) and related regulations £1134 C.F.R. § 300.511
through § 300.520 also authorize special education hearings.

Section 10-76(1-1 (a) (7), R.C.S.A., provides that eligibility for special education sewices
ends at the end of the school year in which the student turns twenty-one. The 1986
Commentary publlshed by the Connecticut State Depanment of Education with the
Special Education Regulations advises that when a student eligible for special education
becomes 21 during the school year, the entitlement to special education continues to the
end of the school year but does not include summer educational sewiccs (also called

Extended School Year).
I

Section 10—94g (a) (1), C.G.S., and 34 C.F.R. § 300.519 require the Commié’sioner of
Education to appoint a Surrogate Parent to represent a child who is eligible for speein1
education and whose patents are unknown or unavailable, or a child who is a ward of the
State. Speciﬁcally, 34 C.F.R. § 300.519 (g) enumerates the responsibilities ofa
Surrogate Parent:

The surrogate parent may represent the chi1d in all matters relating to —

1) The identiﬁcation, evaluation, and educationa1 placement of the child; and

 

 

April 28, 201 1 Final Decision and Order 1 1-0239

2) The provision of FAPB to the child.

Section 34 ORR. § 300.323 (e) provides that when a student with a disability who has an
IEP transfers from one public agency to another public agency within the same state
during the school year, the new public agency:
... must provide FAPE to tlte child (including services comparable to those
described in the child’s YEP from the previous public agency), until the new
public agency either —
(l) Adopts the child’s IEP from the previous public agency; 01‘
(2) Develops, adopts, and implements a new 1131’ that meets the appiicabie
requirements in §§ 300.320 through 300.324.
In this case, the prior public agency is Uniﬁed School District #2 and the new public
agency is the Board of Education within whose jurisdiction the Student had moved.

At 34 C.F.R. § 300.154, the Federal Regulations for special education require states to
establish interageney agreements to ensure that students with disabihties receive FAPE
when other agencies (such as DCF and DDS) are involved with such students. Evidence
of this cooperation is the standard form used by DCF to notify school districts that a
student within the cure of DCF is moving into a speciﬁc school district, as was done for
this Student. This cooperation broke down when the Board’s Staff discovered that they
had received only part of the ctm‘ent IEP: a simple clerical error resulted in a month’s
delay in transmittal of the basic document needed for providing special education
sewices. The Board had timely notice 01‘ Student's arrival in the school district: they
should have pursued the missing documentation in a timely manner.

Although neither the Federal District Court nor the Second Circuit Count of Appeals
granted compensatory education beyond a student’s 21‘I bitthday, in Wenger v. Cnnaslom
Cenn'alSclwolDislricl, 979 F.Supp. 147 (N.DtN.Y. 1997), 26 IDELR 1128, the District
Court held that when a “gross violation” has occurred, compensatory education may
extend beyond age 21 (Mrs. C, v, Wheaten, 916 F.2d 69, 75 (2d Cir. 1990; Gm'ro v.
Connecticut. 23 F.3d 734, 737 (1994)). In Uniﬁed School Disn'icrNo. I v. Connecticut
Department OfEducalion, 780 A.2d 154 (Connecticut Appellate Court, 2001), 35 IDELR
30, the Court held that a telephone call from DCF to the school district was sufﬁcient
notice that an IEP existed, and that compensatory education awarded by a hearing ofﬁcer
because of the delay in providing special education sewices was upheld.

Considering the tnulti-agency meeting on 1 1/22/2010, there was notice and sufficient
information provided for the Board stat 1‘ present to identify an existing program suitable
for Student, To then claim that additional information is needed prior to any phtcement is

a violation 0f34 C.F.R, § 300.323 (e).

A theory that a ten-day lapse in educational services is permissible is found in Goss v.
Lopez, 419 us 565 (1975), which prescribed minimal clue process rights for students
facing suspension of up to ten days from school for disciplinary infractions. Another E
“ten-day standard” is found at Section 10-76d-15 (c), R.C.S.A., which provides that ;
homebotmd instmction be provided “no later than two weeks from the ﬁrst day of '

 

April 28, 201 1 Final Decision and Order 1 1-0239

absence”. Neither of these scenarios applies to a severely multiply disabled youngster
whose residence has changed from one Connecticut school district to another.

Another useﬁil comment concerning the award of compensatory education can be found

at Parenls of Student W. v. PuyaI/up School District, 31 F.3d 1489, 1497 (9lh Cir, 1994):
“..C0mpensatory education is not a contractual remedy, but an equitable remedy,
part of the couit’s resources in eruﬁing “appropriate relief."

DISCUSSION

Student’s special education needs are many and complex, but no Board Staff member
expressed doubts about his placement in their Transition Program. The staff to student
ratio in that program suggests that an additional student could have been accommodated
quickly, Although the loss of fourteen school days might be considered trivial, it is a
serious matter for any student with severe disabilities. In this case, the Student is blind
and cognitively impaired. The Board representatives knew that the Board’s Transition
Program would be appropriate for Student and discussed that placement at the

1 1/22/2010 meeting. Section 34 CPR. § 300.323 (e) is clear: Student should have been
enrolled immediately. If there were doubts about Student’s behavior, the Board could
easily have assigned a paraprofessional, one-on-one, to assist in his transition and

monitor behavior.

The Board owes Student compensatory sewices. 1n the midst of transitioning into DDS
sewices which stress acquisition of skills for supported employment, a mere extension of
his Board program for founcen additional days is not necessarily appropriate and may in
fact interfere with his DDS placement. Therefore, the award shall be planned by the
Board‘s PPT to supplement sewices currently being provided. Student shalt receive
additional individualized Speech/Language sewices to help Student communicate more
effectively and the addition of Music Therapy to his program, recognizing his enjoyment
of music. Since the PPT will have to fit these services around his current program and
around the DDS program commencing soon, these additional sewices shall be scheduled
for one hour a day, four days a week, until September 1, 201 1.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The Board’s delay in enrolling Student was a violation ofIDEA and a denial of FAPE.

The Student was deprived of FAPB for approximately fourteen school days. The Board
is ordered to provide two one—hour Speech/Language sessions and two one~hour Music ,
Therapy sessions each week until September 1, 2011, and to furnish transportation if that ;

is necessary.

The Board’s PPT shall meet with Student, his Surrogate Parent, and a group home
representative to work out the details of providing these services. 1

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing officer within ﬁfteen days aﬁer
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 14] 5(i)(2)(A).
