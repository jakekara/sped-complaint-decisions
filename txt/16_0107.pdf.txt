SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as having a Speciﬁc Learning Disability and is entitled to receive FAPE as
deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq.
and Connecticut General Statutes §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the
Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2015—2016 school year and requested
reimbursement for their unilateral placement of the Student at Eagle Hill School. The Board refused the
Parents’ request. On August 21, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process.
An impaitial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on August 21, 2015 and a pre—hearing conference was held on
August 26, 2015. The parties agreed to forego a resolution meeting and mediated the matter on October 21,
2015. At the October 29, 2015 hearing date, the palties were able to ﬁnalize an agreement and the matter
was withdrawn with prejudice. The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to
November 4, 2015 to accommodate the hearing date.
