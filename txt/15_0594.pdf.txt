March 4, 2016 F inal Decision and Order 15-0594/16-0011

SUMMARY:

Student was repeatedly referred for Special Education, ﬁrst by the District and later by Parents,
but Student was never found eligible, mainly on the basis of Student’s achievement in the
classroom and average achievement testing results. Student’s struggles to complete reading and
written work persisted throughout her time in District. Student was diagnosed with Dyslexia and
Dyscalculia in 2014. These diagnoses were the result of a thorough and detailed
neuropsychological evaluation which was not properly considered by the PPT. While Student’s
achievement testing and grades appeared to demonstrate adequate progress through the
curriculum, the complex nature of Student’s disability, as revealed through her recent diagnosis
and evaluations, requires remediation in order address signiﬁcant deﬁcits that were not easily
discovered due to the complexity of Student’s presentation.

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes (CGS) §10--
76h and related regulations, 20 USC §1415(f) and related regulations, and in accordance with the

testing done as a result 01" a referral for special education placed Student in the average
range in all but two areas where she tested below average. (1d,) 111 the area of reading
readiness, the Student tested above average. (1d,)

At a PP’I‘ meeting on December 4, 2010, the District agreed to Parents’ request for an
outside evaluation of Student to rule out Autism Spectrum Disorder, to conduct in-district
evaluations of Student’s phonological awareness and pragmatic language and to assess
Student’s behavior through the completion of behavior ratings scales. (B-l)

On April 22, 201 1, a psychoeducational evaluation report obtained by the District
pursuant to the December 14, 2010 PPT meeting was issued by Dr. Erik Mayville,
Clinical Psychologist. (Testimony of Parent Advocate; B-2) During the course of his
evaluation, Dr. Mayville administered the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)
assessment, after which he ruled out Autism. (B—Z, p. 26) Dr. Mayville’s report noted that
Student results on the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children (“WISC”) were average
in all areas with the exception of processing speed which was in the low average range.
(B-Z, p 16) Reading ﬂuency and decoding tasks, as Well as math fact ﬂuency were noted
as challenges. (B-2, p. 16) Student was also noted as being at great risk for developing a
mood and/or anxiety disorder as well as fulther difﬁculties in academics. (B—2, p. 17) Dr.
Mayville recommended a low—stress Working environment, regular social skill
programming at school, programming to increase self—management through self-
mcnitoring, participation in online remedial reading programs, direct instruction in the
areas of spelling and writing, monthly parent and school team meetings for generalizing
strategies across the home and school environments, regular assistance at school in areas
where Student stwggles and a weekly review. (B—2, pp. 17—21) He also recommended
consultation with a neuropsychologist and/or behavior analyst with experience with
executive function difﬁculties for assisting staff. (B-2, p.17)

On May 4, 2011, Dr. Mayville issued an addendum to his psychoeducational evaluation
report at Mother’s request, in which he clariﬁed statements in his evaluation regarding
Student’s risk for mood disorders and anxiety and her risk for further difﬁculties in
academics. (Testimony of Mother, October 2, 2015, B-2, pp. 20-21) Dr. Mayville
clariﬁed that the risk for mood and anxiety disorders was quantiﬁed as great based on
Student’s scores in the 90th percentile for mood and 8lst percentile for anxiety. (B-Z,
p.20) He then clariﬁed that despite Student’s cognitive and academic standardized test
scores she may display learning disability-level difﬁculties in the area of writing. (B-2,
p.20) Dr. Mayville noted the disparity between Student’s performance on standardized
tests compared with her difﬁculty with school work as the basis for the concern about
writing. (B-Z, p.20) While Dr. Mayville suggested that this disparity could suggest a
Disorder of Written Expression, he did not make that diagnosis, indicating that the
Student’s educational team should begin to do a functional assessment in that skill area,
including a curriculum-based assessment in order to analyze whether Student’s functional
skills would make her eligible for Special Education under the category of learning
disability. (B-2, p.21)

On May 10, 2011, a District school psychologist, Ms. Kristin Lutz, evaluated Student’s
behavior and social skills within the school setting through observations and
administration of the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition
(“BASC-Z”), classroom observation and student intewiew. (B—3, pp.l-6) Student did not
display behaviors of concern during the obseiyations by Ms. Lutz. (B-3, p.l) Student was

rated in the At Risk range by Parent in the composite areas of Internalizing Problems and

Adaptive skills. (B-3, p.2) Student was rated as clinically signiﬁcant in the composite
area of Internalizing Problems. (B—3, p.2) Student self—reported spelling as hard during
her interview with the school psychologist. (B-2, p.2)

In the spring of 2013, the PPT agreed to conduct a full evaluation of Student.(B-6) Ms.
Lutz conducted a psychoeducational evaluation as a result of this decision and issued a
report on May 20, 2013. (B—7) As part of the evaluation, Ms. Lutz had the Parent and a
teacher complete the BASC—2 scales again and had Student complete the self-report scale
as well. (B-7, pp. 4-5) Parent and teacher rated Student in the Average range for all
composite areas. (B-7, p. 5) Student’s self—repmt was average in all composite areas but
critical items noted were responses of “Sometimes” in response to the statements: “No
one understands me”, “I feel sad” and “I hate school.” (B-7, p. 5) In her interview with
Ms. Lutz, Student stated that spelling, writing, grammar and punctuation were hard. (B—7,
p. 5) Student tested as having a full scale IQ of 91 , which is within the average range, per
her results on the WISC—IV. (B—7, p.2) Signiﬁcant discrepancies were noted between

Student’s score in the area of Processing speed which fell in the borderline range and
placed Student in the 5th percentile and Student’s scores in the average range for all other
composite scores. (B-7, p.2) Ms. Lutz also administered achievement testing through the
Weschler Individual Achievement Test - Third Edition (“WlAT-lll”). (B-8, pp. 4-5)
Student’s score on the Reading Composite was in the average range (25th percentile). (B-
8, p.5) Student’s composite score in Written Expression was also average (47th
percentile), although it should be noted that this composite score was derived from
extremely divergent scores on the subtests from below average (13th percentile) 0n
Spelling to above average (88th percentile) in sentence composition. (B-7, p.4) Student’s
Mathematics composite score was average (55th percentile), while her Math ﬂuency
composite score was signiﬁcantly lower (4th percentile) and which fell in the below
average range. (B—7, p.4) Ms. Lutz noted that it was the speed at which Student was able
to complete the tasks, not her accuracy, that had resulted in such a low score. (B-7, p.4)

A language evaluation of Student was conducted by Ms. Marcena Sass, M.S, CCC-SLP,
a member of the Region 6 staff, and a written report was issued on May 9, 2013. (B-8, p.
1—3) Only one test, the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals - 4th edition
(“CELF—4”) was administered for this evaluation. (ld.) This test assessed Student’s
language competency in the areas of semantics and syntax; Student scored within the
average range for all subtests. Such subtests scores are combined to generate a “Core
Language Score” which reﬂects Student’s overall language competency. Gd.) Student’s
Core Language Score was also in the solidly average range. (Id.) Direct language
intervention was deemed unnecessary by the evaluator based on the CELF-4 results. (B—
8, p.3)

On February 23, 2014, the District’s Language Arts Coordinator conducted an
assessment of Student’s written language. (B-1 1, pp. 1—2) The Language Aits
Coordinator administered the Test of Written Language (“TOWL—4”). Gd.) Student’s
scores were average and above average on all of the subtests of the TOWL-4 that were
administered, with the exception of the spelling subtest, on which Student scored a 7
which put her at below the average range of 8-12. (B-1 1, p.1) Student’s composite
writing scores in both contrived and spontaneous writing were above average. (B—1 1, p.2)
Student’s overall writing score was also above average. (Id.) The evaluator identiﬁed

spelling as an area of relative weakness for Student and recommended Student be
permitted to keep a word list and dictionaly with her for reference while writing. (Id.)
The Language Arts Coordinator also conducted a Qualitative Reading Invent01y (“QRI-
5”) during the spring of 2014, the results of which were reported at a PPT meeting held
on May 13, 2014. (B—18; B—19, p. 3) Student required extra time to complete the QRl—S
and with the extra time her comprehension was on grade 1eVe1. (1d,) Student’s ﬂuency
was slightly below average. Gd.) Recommendations based on the QRI-S were to permit
use of audio books, some support at home with oral reading of text to strengthen ﬂuency,
and extra time to read novels for class assignments. (B-18)

On April 10, 2015, an Occupational Therapy/Assistive Technology Screening was
completed by Ms. Eve Moura, MS, OTR/L, who Worked for Education Connection, one
of Connecticut’s Regional Education Service Centers. (13-13, pp.1-4) This was not a full
assistive technology evaluation, but rather a pre-screening evaluation conducted to
determine whether or a full assistive technology screening was necessary. (B-13, p.1) Ms.
Moura administered the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abi1ities
(“WRAVMA”) during this evaluation. On the WRAVMA, Student scored in the average
range in the subtest of Drawing as a test of Visual-Motor skills (68th percentile) and in
the subtest of Pegboard which tests Fine Motor skills (16th percentile). (B-13, pp.1-2)
Student’s score in the subtest of Matching, which tests Visual-Spatial skills, was in the
below average range as it fell in the 9th percentile. (1d,) Student’s composite on the
WRAVMA was in the average range. (B-13, p.2) The disparity between the scores was
not analyzed in the evaluation. Ms. Moura did note that applications and programs might
assist her in the classroom with note taking as “...Student’s pace of work hinders her
performance.” (B-13, p.2)

In the Fall of 2014, Parents retained the services of Timothy Heitzman, PhD. to conduct

a Neuropsychological Evaluation. (P22, p.1-12) Dr. Heitzman holds a PhD from the
University of Rhode Island in School Psychology, an MA. in Clinical Psychology from
Loyola College, MD, and a BS. in Psychology from La Salle University. (P-96) Dr.
Heitzman was also a Postdoctoral Fellow and then an Advanced Fellow at Boston
Children’s Hospital for a period of ﬁve years. (Id.) Based on Dr. Heitzman’s experience,
training and the quality of his report, his analysis and recommendations were given
signiﬁcant weight.

On September 30, 2015 and October 1, 2014, Dr. Timothy Heitzman conducts a
neuropsychological evaluation of Student and subsequently generates a report of his
ﬁndings. (Joint Stipulation; P—22) Dr. Heitzman obtained information in the form of
completed BASC forms from District staff, but did not speak with anyone from the
District nor observe Student in an educational setting prior to completing his report.

(J oint Stipulation) As of the date of Dr. Heitzman’s evaluation in the F all of 2014,
Mother reported Student’s anxiety is under control. (P-22)

Dr. Heitzman arranged for Parent, Teacher and Student to complete the BASC-2 again.
(P22, p.3-4) Mother did not report signiﬁcant problems but noted an at-risk level of
social withdrawal. (Id.) Student’s history teacher reported no signiﬁcant or at risk
problems, however Student’s Language Arts teacher endorsed at-risk levels of attention
and learning problems, as well as atypical behavior and low levels of leadership. (Id.)
Student endorsed a high level of frustration with school and a poor attitude to school in

with initiation and working memory and was at-risk 01' had signiﬁcant trouble with
planning. (Id.) The Language Arts teacher reported difﬁculty with self—monitoring as
well.

On Dr. Heitzman’s administration of the WISC—IV, Student’s scores placed her in the
average range for her General Ability Index with a 108. (P-22, p. 5) Student’s working
memory and processing speed test results varied from average to below average, with
coding being a particular weakness in the area of processing speed. (Id.)

Dr. Heitzman utilized the Delis-Kaplan Executive F unction System (“D—KEFS”) and the
Conner’s Continuous Performance Test (“CPT—H”) to evaluate Student’s attention and
executive functioning. (P—22, p. 5) Student’s performance on the CPT-II placed her in the
average range for attention functioning. (Id.) Student’s performance on the D—KEFS
Varied from average to deﬁcient executive functioning. (Id.)

The Rey—Osterreith Complex Figure (“ROCF”) and the Beery—Buktenia Developmental
Test of Visual—Motor Integration (“VMI”) were administered by Dr. Heitzman to assess
Student’s nonverbal processing. Student’s score on the VMI was average, but her scores
on the ROCF exposed weaknesses in encoding as the complexity of the test increased. (P-
22, 13.6)

The Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (“CTOPP-Z”) and the
Deve1opmental Neuropsychological Evaluation (“NEPSY-II”) were used to assess
Student’s Verbal processing. The NEPSY—H subtest utilized showed Student has below
average receptive language skills and the CTOPP—2 scores placed Student well below
average in her phonological processing skills. (P22, 13. 7)

Student’s learning and memory scores on the Children’s Memory Scale (“CMS”) ranged
from below average to average. (P22, pp. 7—8)

Academic skills and achievement were measured through administration of the Gray Oral
Reading Test—S (“GORT—S”), Test of Word Reading Efﬁciency —2 (“TOWRE-Z”), and
Weschler Individual Achievement Test (“WIAT—IH”) (13.22, p.8-9) Achievement
weaknesses were evident in areas of basic reading, reading efﬁciency, spelling and math
calculations and ﬂuency. (P—22, p.8)

Dr. Heitzman’s evaluation diagnosed Student with Dys1exia and Dyscalculia. (P-22, pp.
9—10) His clinical impressions identiﬁed Student as having an anxious temperament,
rather than an anxiety disorder. (P-22, p. 10)

Dr. Heitzman’s recommendations included specialized instruction, including a reading
program which is speciﬁcally designed to address Student’s reading disorder of Dyslexia
and specialized instruction in math fact and calculation ﬂuency. (P-22, p.11) Other
recommendations include continued use of a calculator as a support in math class and use
of audible textbooks through programs such as bookshareorg. (Id.) In order to address
Student’s executive functioning deﬁcits, Dr. Heitzman provided a list of suggested tasks
to be implemented at home and in school, including chunking long assignments, writing
out instructions, use of preferential seating, and use of extra time. (P22, p. 11-12) Dr.
Heitzman recommended summer programming for Student to provide the opportunity for
Student to catch up with her peers. (1’22, p.12) He also recommended a foreign language

waiver and counseling to address her anxiety. (Id.) Monitoring of progress consisting of
standardized testing taking place at yearly intervals and a follow up neuropsychological
in 2 years was recommended. (P.22, p.11)

Upon receipt of Dr. Heitzman’s written repOIt, in which Student was diagnosed with
Dyslexia and Dyscalculia, Parents shared the report with the District and requested
another PPT meeting. (J oint Stipulation).

in early 2015, Parents retained the services of Patricia Bennett—Bigham, an Oiton-
Gillingham practitioner and school and reading consultant (Testimony of Bennett-
Bigham 10/ 16/2015) Ms. Bennett—Bigham holds a BA in Psychology from Duquesne
University, an MA in Clinical PsychoIogy from the University of Dayton, and an MBA
from Rutgers University. (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham 10/ 16/2015, p.23; P—8, 13.2).
Having completed 45 hours of coursework and 100 hours of practicum, Ms. Bennett-
Bigham, earned the “Associate” level certiﬁcation from the Academy of Orton
Gillingham Practitioners and Educators in 2004. (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham,
10/1‘6/2015, p.29) Although she completed additional training and practicum hours, Ms.
Bennett—Bigham has not applied for the “Certiﬁed” level offered by the Academy.
(Testimony of Bennett—Bigham, 10/16/2015, p.29) Ms. Bennett-Bigham began consulting
with school districts in 2003 and continues to do so, in addition to her work with parents.
As part of her consultation work she conducts assessments. (Testimony of Bennett-
Bigham, 10/16/2015, p.26 and p.29)

Ms. Bennett~Bigham’s experience and training as well as the quality and detail of her
repott were found to be considerable and testimony weighed accordingly, although as an
Orton—Giilingham practitioner, her recommendation of that speciﬁc program for Student
was weighed with consideration that such a recommendation may be based in pait in self—
interest.

On April 18, 2015, Patricia Bennett—Bigham generated a document tit1ed Comprehensive
Reading and Math Assessment. (Testimony of Bennett-Bigham, 10/ 16/2015, p.37; 13-7,
pp.1—29) As part of her assessment, Ms. Bennett—Bigham reviewed Student’s report cards,
as well as school and private assessments, which included the reports of Dr. Mayville and
Dr. Heitzman. (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham, 10/16/2015, p.36 and p. 54; P-7, p.1)

Ms. Bennett—Bigham met with Student on four occasions between F ebruary 20, 2015 and
March 20, 2015 during Student’s eighth grade year. (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham,
10/16/2015 p.36, p.47; P—7, p.1) She also met with Mother. (Testimony of Bennett-
Bigham, 10/16/2015 p.36, P—7, p.1)

Ms. Bennett—Bigham did not have any contact with District staff, nor she did she observe
Student in any educational settings, prior to completing her eva1uation. (J oint Stipulation)
As part of her assessment Ms. Bennett—Bigham administered the Word Identiﬁcation and
Spelling Test«Seconda1-y Level Grades 6—12 (“WIST”). (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham,
10/16/2015, p.36; P—7, p.5—8) The WIST standard scores have a mean of 100 and a
standard deviation of 15. (P—7, p.5 ) The standard score average range is 90 to 110. (Id.)
Student’s composite score on the WIST is referred to as the Fundamental Literacy Index.
(Testimony of Bennett—Bigham, 10/16/2015, p. 41; P—7, p. 8) Student’s composite score
was a 77 based on age and a 71 based on grade. (P-7, pp. 7—8.) These scores placed
Student in the poor range. (P—7, p.7) Student’s scores fell in the poor range on the WIST
subtests of Word Identiﬁcation, on which Student scored a 79 based on age and a 70
based on grade level, and Spelling, on which Student scored a 78 based on age and a 74

based on grade level. (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham, 10/15/2015, P-7, p. 8) Student’s
scores on the Supplemental Sound—Symbol Knowledge Subtest fell in the vely poor range
with Student scoring a 68 based on her grade level and a 62 based on her age. Student
showed strength in the area of in'egular non-phonetic sight words and she was able to
read these words with automatieity and accuracy. (P-7, 13.6) Student was only able to
identify the sounds of 20 of 25 consonants and 10 0f 15 of the sounds for basic Vowels
and only 18 of 48 Vowel combinations When given this subtest and her results placed her
at a ﬁrst grade level. (Testimony of Bennett-Bigham, 10/15/2015, pp. 44—45). Student’s
results in all areas were below a ﬁfth grade level (Testimony of Bennett-Bigham,
10/15/2015, P-7, p.8)

The second test administered by Ms. Bennett-Bigham was the Qualitative Reading
Inventory (“QRI-S). (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham, 10/15/2015, pp. 45—46; P-7, pp. 9-
13) Student’s scores on the QRI-S Word List tests identiﬁed her as able to read 3rd
through 5th grade word lists at the independent level (90-100% accuracy). (P-7, p.9)
Student’s ability to read the 6th grade word lists placed her at the instmetional level (70—
80% accuracy) and when tested on Upper Middle School and High School words her
performance placed her at the frustration level (below 70% accuracy). (Testimony of
Bennett-Bigham, 10/15/2015, pp. 46; P—7, p9)

Student’s scores on the QRI—S indicated that for a ﬁction passage leveled at Grade 7—8
Student’s accuracy and comprehension was at the instructional level. (Testimony of
Bennett—Bigham, 10/15/2015, p. 51; P—7, p.10) Student’s accuracy score when reading the
non—ﬁction passage was also at the instructional level, however her comprehension score
was at the frustration level. (1d,) With both passages, Student’s comprehension rose to
independent when she was permitted to look back through the text in order to respond to
questions. (P-7, p.11)

The third test administered by Ms. Bennett—Bigham was the Test of Word Reading
Efﬁciency-Z, Form B (“TOWRE-Z”) which tests the ability to pronounce printed words
accurately and ﬂuently. (P-7, p.13) The average score on this test is 100 with a standard
deviation of 15, resulting in an average score range of 90—1 10. (1d.) Student’s sight word
efﬁciency subtest score placed her in the 7th percentile, at the grade equivalent of third
grade and in the poor range. (Testimony of Bennett-Bigham, 10/15/2015, pp. 52—53; P—7,
p.13) Student’s score on the Phonemic Decoding Efﬁciency subtest placed her in the 13th
percentile and also at a third grade equivalent and in the below average range. (Id.)
Student’s composite Total Word Reading Efﬁciency Index score placed her in the poor
range and in the 8th percentile. (P—7, p.14)

The next test administered by Bennett-Bigham were the Memory for Digits and Non-
word Repetition subtests of the Phonological Memory Composite. Phono1ogical Memory
subtest of Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (“CTOPP”). (P-7, p.15)
CTOPP subtests of Phonological Awareness and Rapid Naming had been administered
by Dr. Tim Heitzman within a year (10/2014) of Bennett-Bigham’s administration of the
Phonological Memory subtest, and so were not administered by her, although the results
of Heitzman’s administration were noted and analysis of these were included in Bennett-
Bigham’s assessment. (P—7, pp.14-15) Student’s composite score for Phonological
memory placed her in the 16th percentile and in the below average range. (Testimony of
Bennett-Bigham, 10/15/2015, pp. 45; P—7, 15.

Bennett—Bigham also administered the Test of Written Language—4 — Form B— (“CTOWL-
4”). (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham, 10/15/2015, p. 55; 13-7, pp.16—17) Student’s overall
writing composite score was in the average range (P-7, p. 17) Student’s composite score
for contrived writing was within the average range and within the 45th to 50th percentile
based on Student’s age and grade level. (M) A strength for Student was reflected in her
scoring in the superior range for her spontaneous writing. (Testimony of Bennett-
Bigham, 10/15/2015, pp. 55-56; P-7, pp. 16—17)

The Test of Reading Comprehension—3 (“TORC-3”) was administered by Bennett-
Bigham during her assessment and Student scores on all subtests were within the average
range. (P-7, p. 18) Student’s composite score of 92 on the Reading Comprehension
Quotient fell in the low end of the average range and in the 30th percentile. (P-7, p. 18—
19)

Bennett-Bigham concluded her assessment with administration of the Key Math-3
Diagnostic Assessment (“Key-Math-3 DA”). Student scored in the average range in the
three areas tested, Basic Concepts, Operations and Applications. 111 Basic Concepts,
Student’s score fell in the 37th percentile. In Operations, Student’s score fell in the 27th
percentile and in Applications Student’s score was in the 47th percentile. Bennett-
Bigham noted that Student cannot automatically retrieve math facts for addition,
subtraction multiplication or division. (P—7, pp122—23) She noted that completion of the
multiplication and division worksheet took an exorbitant amount of time (at least twice
the normal administration) and that Student had inefﬁcient means of solving problems
involving these operations. (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham, 10/15/2015, p. 63; P-7, p.22)
As a result of her testing and review of Student’s records, Bennett—Bigham conﬁrmed Dr.
Heitzman’s diagnoses of Dyslexia and Dyscalculia. (J oint Stipulation) To address
Student’s needs based on these diagnoses, Bennett—Bigham recommended age—
appropriate, focused intensive, direct and explicit instruction in decoding and encoding
both in isolation and in connected text whether for reading or for written expression.
With such instruction to be multisensory in nature and taught in a sequential and
cumulative way by a specialist, certiﬁed in a multisensory in language based program
who has at least 5 years of experience with both middle and high school students. (P-7, p.
25). Bennett—Bigham indicated that such instruction should be delivered for an hour to 90
minutes a day ﬁve days a week and would likely take two years. (Testimony of Bennett-
Bigham, 10/15/2015, pp. 73-75) She also recommended progress monitoring built into
the explicit instruction on a daily basis and annually. (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham,
10/15/2015, pp. 77-78)

Bennett—Bigham also recommended explicit instruction in spelling, assistance with the
acquisition of math facts, and an Assistive Technology Evaluation. (P-7, p. 26)
Bennett—Bigham included a list of suggested accommodations for Student, grounded in
her overall recommendations (P-7, pp. 25-27) These accommodations included
exemption from foreign language requirement, extra time for quizzes and tests, access to
a computer and spellcheck at all times, use of a calculator for all math work and
assessments, class notes and study guides for all classes, materials presented orally and
visually, multisensory teaching, oral response when written response is incomplete and
the ability to expand on written responses orally on all work and assessments, repetition
of directions and key points, ohunking of long assignments into several shorter ones,

connection of new information and leaming t0 meaningful prior knowledge and the
provision of a reader or audio reader for all class work, home work and assessments.
When Bennett—Bigham completed her report, Parents shared it with the District and
requested a PPT meeting. (Joint Stipulation)

On June 8, 2015, Ms. Bennett—Bigham generated a second document titled “Extended
School Year Recommendation”, in which she recommended that Student receive three to
four hours a day four to ﬁve days a week instruction in the modality and by a provider
with the experience levels described in her comprehensive evaluation. (Testimony of
Bennett—Bigham, 10/ 15/201 5, p.83, P-11) 1mp1ementation of this intensive regimen
would reduce the time needed to address Student’s needs down from the two years
anticipated in her report. (Testimony of Bennett—Bigham, 10/15/2015, p.83)

Student’s performance on the Connecticut Mastery Test (“CMT”) in third grade placed
her at the basic level for Math and Reading and Writing. (P—73) Student’s performance on
the Connecticut Mastery Test (“CMT”) in fourth grade placed her at goal for Math and
Reading and proﬁcient in Writing. (B—21 , p.2) These scores represented growth in these
areas since Student was tested in third grade. (B—21, p14) Student’s performance on the
CMT in ﬁfth grade placed her at the proﬁcient level for Mathematics and Reading and at
goal for Writing and Science. (B-21, p.6) These scores represented growth in these areas
since Student was tested in fourth grade, although growth in the area of reading was
much lower (only 4 points) than the growth in the prior year (68 points). (B-21, p.8)

Student’s performance on the CMT in sixth grade placed her at goal for Math and
Reading and Writing. (B-21, p.10) These scores represented growth in these areas since
Student was tested in third grade. (B-21, p.4)

During the time Student was emolled in middle school, beginning in the 2013-2014
school year) the District began to implement progress monitoring in Math and Reading
through a computer program called the STAR program. (Testimony of Assistant
Principal, 12/ 14/2015) STAR testing when it is utilized for progress monitoring is
generally done on a monthly basis. (Testimony of Assistant Principal, 12/14/2015) On
occasion, a teacher may have a Student take the test again (before the next monthly test
date) if Student is observed to have an off day 01‘ the teacher feels that particular score is

not reﬂective of Student’s true ability. (Testimony of Assistant Principal, 12/ 14/2015)
The Assistant Principal, who was in charge of impIementation of the Star assessment
program in the District, has found it puzzling that STAR test results can be lower at the
end of the year than at earlier points during the year, and that such lower results do not
always accurately reﬂect what teachers believe students are capable of in the classroom.
(1d)

Student’s scores on STAR testing are erratic and do not follow a pattern, (Testimony of
Assistant Principal, 12/14/2015)

Student’s STAR progress monitoring results for the 7th grade year show a rise and then
fall over the course of the year. (B-17) Student scored a scaled score of 455 in September
a 609 2013. In November 2013 she score a 609 and in December 2013, she scored an
849. She dropped to an 819 in January 2014, after which she scored a 715 in March, 2014
and 737 in April, 2014. (13-17, p.2)

A STAR student progress monitoring report was generated on May 13, 2014 reﬂecting

student’s progress in STAR assessments in her seventh grade year to date. (B—17)
Student’s test results over this period of time Varied widely from a low scaled score of

455 in September of2013 to a high of 849 in December and then back down to scores in
the 700 range in March and April of 2014 (1d.) The trend line calculated by the program
after 4 tests have been taken indicated that Student was on growth trajectory. (Id.)

In Student’s eighth grade year, her STAR results also lacked a clear pattern. On

September 12, 2014, Student scored a 552, which placed her in the 12th percentile. (P—2)
On October 20, 2014, Student scored a 787, which placed her in the 35th percentile. (Id.)
On November 10, 2010, Student scored a 653, which placed her in the 22nd percentile.
(1d.) On November 25, 2014, Student scored a 545, which placed her in the 11th
percentile. (1d,) On J anuary 21, 2015, Student scored a 655, which placed her in the 20th
percentile. (1d,) On February 23, 2015, Student scored a 792, which placed her in the
32nd percentile. (Id.) On April 10, 2015, Student scored an 847 on this test, which placed
her in the 35th percentile. (Id.) On November 10, 2015, Student scored a 653, which
placed her in the 22nd percentile. (Id.)

The STAR program characterized Student’s April 10, 2015 score of 847 as placing
Student in a category called “On Watch”. (P.13) On May 11, 2015, A STAR student
progress monitoring repon was administered to Student. (P-2) Student scored a 647 on
this test which the report indicated put her on a Lexile measure of 895L and which placed
her in the 17th percentile and within the zone where intervention was needed. (Id.)

On May 25, 2015, the Assistant Principal sent an email to Mother with the latest STAR
results, in which she noted the 200 point drop in score from the prior test and asked
Mother if she wants Student to take the test again. (P-4) Mother responded that she does
not want to have her retake it and indicated that Student reported she did not have extra
time on the test and that was why her score was so low. (1d,) Mother explained her belief
that extra time is why Student is successful. (Id.)

On September 10, 2015, Student’s freshman year in high school, Student had a scaled
score of 702 on the STAR reading test, which according to the STAR program is the
grade equivalent of 6.3, with an independent reading level of 5.9. (B—28) When tested two
months later, on November 13, 2015, Student scored a 799 which placed her at a grade
equivalent of 7.0 with an independent reading level of 6.3. (B—28 ,p.1) The results of this,
according to the STAR program, are that Student in the 26th percentile, which is at the
bottom of the average range. (B-28, p.2)

STAR Math results from testing on November 9, 2015 placed Student in the 9th
percentile. (B—28, p.3', P-21)

The District had a very liberal retake policy in place while Student was enrolled in
middle school. This policy was applied to all Students regardless of identiﬁcation under

Section 504 0r IDEA. The conditions under which a Student could retake an assessment
or redo an assignments during Student’s seventh and eighth grade year were not speciﬁed
by the District, and each teacher could make his or her determination of when retakes
could be done. (Testimony of Assistant Principal, 12/ 14/2015) Student’s eighth grade
history teacher permitted retakes on all of his assignments. Student’s ninth grade English
teacher repoxted that the 2015-2016 school-wide policy had been reﬁned so that it was
made clear that students are permitted to retake anything once. (Testimony of Region 6
grade 9 English Teacher, 12/ 14/2015) The Assistant Principal also clariﬁed that the new
policy that had been put into place at the end of September 01' early October 2015, set a 5
day time limit in which retakes could be requested. (Testimony of Assistant Principal,
12/ 14/2015) Despite the existence of the retake policy, there are students in the District

who do receive grades lower than As and Bs. (Testimony of Assistant Principal,
12/14/2015) Student avails herself of retakes, but not on a more frequent basis than other
students. (Testimony of ninth grade English Teacher, 12/14/2015)

During the 2014—2015 school year, Student retook approximately 50% of her tests and
quizzes. (Testimony of eighth grade History teacher) Had Student not retaken those
assessments her grades on those assignments would have ranged from a 54%—74%.
Student’s ﬁnal grades while enrolled in the District have been for the most part in the A
to B range. (B-15, p.1) (1d,) Challenges for Student have been noted outside the grading
process. English teacher reported she was slow in her reading. (Testimony of Assistant
Principal, 12/14/2015). Math (when aided by a calculator) appears to be a paiticular
strength for Student, who did well in eighth grade and continues to succeed in the
classroom. (Testimony of Student’s eighth and ninth grade Math teacher 12/ 14/2015; B—
15)

Student’s Seventh Grade English Teacher reached out to Parent in October of 2013 after
Student did poorly on a vocabulary test to ask about what had worked for Student in the
prior year. (Testimony of Student’s Seventh Grade English Teacher) This teacher worked
with Student to identify the learning modalities and strategies that worked for her,
speciﬁcally writing, talking it out, and working with a peer and repetition. Gd.) These
strategies addressed Student’s initial difﬁculty With vocabulary in her seventh grade year.
(1d,) Student’s writing was below average compared with peers in seventh grade;
elaboration in particular was a struggle. (Testimony of Student’s Seventh Grade English
Teacher).

Student’s May 2015 progress report for Student’s performance in English was issued by
Wamogo Regional High School which indicated Student was performing at a level of
good or excellent in all areas except the quality of her written assignments and her test
and quiz scores in which the teacher characterized her performance as both fair and good.
(P-3) Student needed to elaborate and explain why the examples she used were important
in a written assignment targeting the skill of comparison. (Id.) The teacher noted that
Student’s performance on quizzes ﬂuctuated and depended on the level of Student’s
preparation. (1d.)

A May 2015 progress report for Student’s performance in US History was issued by
Wamogo Regional High School which indicated Student was performing at a level of
good or excellent in all areas except the quality of her written assignments in which the
teacher characterized her performance as fair and good and Student’s test and quiz scores
in which the teacher characterized her performance as fair. (P—l) Student’s writing was
described by the teacher as being solid but lacking the use of more history speciﬁc
vocabulary. ad.) The teacher noted that Student often retakes traditional quizzes. (Id.)
Student’s January 28, 2015 Pupil Progress Report for US History in eighth grade reﬂects
that Student’s performance falls in the excellent or good categories with the exception of
Test/Quiz Scores and Notebook/Note Taking. Student’s performance in the Test/Quiz
Scores merited the checking of both the Good and Fair boxes and a comment that Student
struggled a bit on the ﬁnal three interim assessments for the quaiter. (P-14) Student’s
performance in Notebook/Notetaking was listed as fair with the comments: “Student
struggles a bit to ascertain what is important for historical texts. She tends to use peer
notes as a guide.” Teacher also noted that Student had not seen teacher for extra help

can get distracted and is self-distracted easily. (Id.)

Student’s performance in English for the ﬁrst half of ninth grade (2015-2016) is average.
(Testimony of Student’s Ninth Grade English Teacher, 12/11/2015) Student’s Section
504 accommodations are implemented by the Student’s Ninth Grade English Teacher.
(Id.) Student’s current writing ability, as obsewed by her English teacher, is quite good
and she demonstrates a veiy good command of sentence structure. (1d,) Student’s
objective test scores in freshman English show she is not retaining all of the information.
(Id.) Student utilizes the retake policy in freshman English. (Testimony of Student’s ninth
grade English Teacher, 12/14/2015)

There can be no doubt that the relationship between the Parents and the District has
broken down. The tenor and content of PPT meetings over time declined in civility. Both
sides have circled the wagons, taking aim and letting ﬂy barbs and accusations, which has
only resulted in pushing the parties further apart. At times during the hearing, the focus
on the child who purportedly was at the center of the dispute was lost amidst attempts to
demean and disparage the professionalism of witnesses on both sides. At this point,
determining who ﬁled the ﬁrst shot is a wasted exercise. The testimony regarding the
behavior of Counsel and the Parent Advocate at PPT meetings is credited, and found to
be evidence of strong advocacy on both sides and weighed as such.

By December 1, 2010, Parents felt they needed to hire an advocate to assist them in
advocating for their child’s needs. Parent requested a referral for Special Education on
December 1, 2010. (Testimony of Mother, 9/9/2015) On December 14, 2010, during
Student’s fourth grade year (2010-2011), a PPT meeting was held. (Testimony of Parent
Advocate, 1 1/13/2015; B—l) The purpose of the meeting was to review the referral of
Student for Special Education and plan an initial evaluation.(B-l. pp. 1-2)

Parent concerns raised via the Parent Advocate at the December 14, 2010 PPT meeting
included that Student was reading at a level 34 when the grade four benchmark was a
level 40, weaknesses in Student’s spelling, and the amount of guidance Student needed to
organize her thoughts before writing. (Testimony of Parent Advocate, 11/ 13/2015) The
Advocate also expressed concerns stemming from the fact that as of the December 14,
2010, PPT meeting, Student was in a tier two intervention which she had been in since
November 19, 2010. The PPT team summary indicated that Student required extra time
on all of her assignments due to a processing speed weakness. (B—l , p.2)

At the December 14, 2010 PPT meeting, the team agreed to have an outside evaluation
conducted to rule out Autism Spectmm Disorder. (B—l , p.2) The team also agreed to have
the school psychologist facilitate the completion of behavior rating scales, and conduct an
observation of Student across school settings. (101.) It was also decided that the speech
pathologist would evaluate phonological awareness and pragmatic language. (1d,) This
testing was done completed and reviewed at a subsequent PPT meeting

A PPT meeting was held on June 4, 2013. (B-9, p.l) In attendance were Mother,
Student’s sixth grade teacher, School Psychologist, special education teacher, Region 6
Speech and Language Professional, Attorney for the Board, Region 6 Reading
Interventionist, a guidance counselor from Wamogo middle school and two seventh grade
teachers, as well as the Parent’s Special Education Advocate. (B—9, p. 1-2) As indicated
on the IEP, the purpose of this PPT meeting was to review the recent evaluations of
Student. (Id.) The PPT meeting summary indicates that the school psychologist and

speech and language professional reported the results of their evaluations at the meeting
(B—9, p.2) Aside from a weakness in the area of processing speed which the school
psychologist characterized as “borderline”, Student had average scores in the subtests of
the WISC and an overall average score of 91. (B—9, 132) Although determining eligibility
was not noted as the purpose of the meeting on the IEP, the PPT determined Student did
not qualify for special services. (Joint Stipulation, B-9, p.2) Student’s educationa1
performance was cited as the reason for determining the Student was not eligible for
Special Education. (B-9, p.3) The PPT indicated that this determination was based on
achievement, cognitive testing, communication testing and classroom obsewation of
Student. (1d.) Parent requested an outside evaluation at this PPT, but withdrew it during
the meeting. (B—9, p. 3)

At the J une 4, 2013 meeting, the Parent Advocate wished to discuss Student’s RTI
program and SRBI information, but Attorney for the Student “...refused to allow this
discussion because it was outside the realm of the PPT, which was to review the
evaluation and determine eligibility for special services.” (B—9, p2)

Mother, when she did not receive the RTI and SRBI information, ﬁled a Comp1aint with
the Connecticut State Department of Education (“CSDE”) which resulted in an order that
the information be supplied to Mother and that another PPT meeting be held to discuss
the results and determine eligibility. (J oint Stipulation) The CSDE also ordered the
completion of the Multidisciplinary Evaluation Repmt for Students Suspected of Having
a Speciﬁc Learning Disability form. (Id.)

Pursuant to the order from the CSDE, the District convened another PPT meeting. (Joint

Stipulation) Again, Student was found ineligible. (101.) Parents requested an IEE including
educational, speech, psychological and reading evaluations. (1d.) The District refused
these requests but did ﬁle a request for a Due Process hearing at this time. (1d,)

On May 13, 2014, at the end of Student’s 7th grade year another PPT meeting was he1d
at the request of Parents to review evaluations and determine eligibihty. (J oint
Stipulation, B—19, p.1) Mother, Attorney for the Parent, Attorney for the Board, Director
of Special Services, a regular education teacher, a special education teacher, a guidance
counselor, Language Arts Coordinator and Leah Smith were in attendance. (1d,)

The PPT again found that the Student was not eligible for Special Education. (Joint
Stipulation, B—19, p.2) The PPT based its ineligibility determination on teacher reports
and the evaluation conducted in February. (B—19, p. 5) Parent requested an Independent
Educational Evaluation (“IEE”) including speech and language assessments and a more
thorough reading comprehension assessment. (B-19 pp. 4 and 6) The TEE request was
refused by the PPT on the basis that Student’s educational performance and the
evaluations that had been done by District staff. (Joint Stipu1ation, B—19, p. 6) The
District ﬁled a request for a Due Process hearing which was assigned to Hearing Ofﬁcer
Rosado, but subsequently dismissed by him without prejudice on July 28, 2014, when
Parents withdrew their request for an IEE on July 2, 2014. (Joint Stipulation)

After the January 28, 2015 PPT meeting found Student ineligible, a Section 504 meeting
was held immediately after the PPT per Parents’ request. (Joint Stipulation)

On Febmai‘y 13, 2015, Mother sent a letter to the Special Education Director which she
asked to be appended to the minutes for the PPT meeting held on J anuary 28, 2015. (P-

12) In this letter Mother indicated that the minutes failed to include that Parents discussed
Student’s avoidance of reading due to the arduous time consuming nature of the task and

17

March 4, 2016 Final Decision and Order 15-0594/16-0011

that despite a reference in the minutes to Mother reading aloud, Mother indicated this was
not discussed at the meeting at all. (ld.) Mother also wished it noted that the school’s
reading specialist did not attend the PPT meeting, that the school psychologist did not
have Student’s STAR test results before the PPT meeting and that the special education
teacher had not reviewed records before the meeting and did not contribute at the
meeting. (ld.) Mother noted the minutes did not reﬂect that there was discussion of the
Fall STAR assessment results and the concerns expressed by Mother and her attorney
about the results. (1d,) Mother also noted that concerns about the evaluation of writing
assignments be noted. (1d,)

86. At the May 2015 PPT Meeting, Dr. Heitzman was in attendance via telephone and Ms.
Bennett-Bigham was present. At this PPT meeting, Bennett—Bigham began to present her
ﬁndings to the PPT, and was told to stop and provide only a summary by the District’s
attorney. (Testimony of Bennett-Bigham, 10/ l 5/2015) Ms. Bennett-Bigham could not
recall any of the School Based PPT members asking her any questions about her report.
(1d,) Similarly Dr, Heitzman’s clariﬁcation or input was not solicited by school staff.

(T estimony of Dr. Heitzman) Given the extensive amount of detail in Dr. Heitzman and
Ms. Bennett-Bigham, the breadth of the instruments used in their assessments, and the
presence of a new diagnosis ﬂowing from the neuropsychological evaluation, the lack of
any questions or substantive conversation about the reports at the meeting was notable.
(Testimony of Dr. Heitzman and Ms. Bennett—Bigham) Fuither the afﬁrmative action of
Attorney for the Board in limiting Ms. Bennett—Bigham’s presentation showed a
disregard for her input from the outset of the meeting. (Testimony of Ms. Bennett—
Bigham) The PPT concluded that Student did not qualify for Special Education Services.
(Joint Stipulation) Parents requested an IEE in Assistive Technology and this request was
refused by District. (ld.) A request to convene a Section 504 meeting after the PPT
meeting concluded was refused by District. (Id.)

87. On J uly 31, 2015, the Board granted the Paxents request for an EB and withdrew the
request for a due process hearing that had been assigned Case Number 15-0594. (Joint
Stipulation)

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DISCUSSION:

This case presents a Dickensian tale of two Students. The dichotomy which must be reconciled
in this decision is that the Board’s Student, by virtue of her grades and the support of her Section
504 plan is progressing without issue through the curriculum and thus needs no specialized
instruction, while the Parent’s Student, in contrast, is totally overwhelmed by academic demands
which she is only able to meet because there are no time contraints on her work—product and her
grades reﬂect endless revisions. The reality, as in most endeavors, lies somewhere in between the
battle lines drawn by Counsel.

1. Dismissal of 15—0594 - Region 6 Board of Education V. Student. As an initial matter, the
issue of whether or not the evaluation conducted by the District was appropriate was withdrawn
by the Board on July 31, 2015, and thus, is dismissed.

2. FAPE for the 2013—2014 and 2014-2015 School Years and as Proposed for 2015—2016

School Year. The standard of review of special education programs for individual students with
disabilities was established by the US. Supreme Court in the case of Board of Educm‘ion of the

18

March 4, 2016 Final Decision and Order 15—0594/16-0011

Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley, 458 US. 176 (1982). That case established
two tests: 1) were the procedural requirements of the Act complied with; and 2) was the
educational program developed for the child reasonably expected to provide educational beneﬁt.
The IDEA establishes numerous procedural safeguards that are designed to allow parents of
children with disabilities to have meaningful involvement in the education sewices provided to
their children. Christopher P, v. Marcus, 16 IDELR 1347 (2d Cir. 1990) Procedural violations
that result in the loss of educational opportunity, or seriously infringe the parents' opportunity to
participate in the IEP formulation process, clearly result in the denial of a FAPE." Target Range,
960 F.2d at 1484 The Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds that the Board denied parents meaningful input in
the PPT process and violated 34 CFR §300.502 when Dr. Heitzman’s and Ms. Bennett—Bigham’s
were all but ignored during the May 2015 PPT meeting. (Finding of Fact 86) Under the IDEA, if
parents obtain an independent educational evaluation at public expense or shares with the
District an evaluation obtained at private expense, the evaluation (1) must be considered by the
District, if it meets agency criteria, in any decision made with respect to the provision of FAPE
to the child; and (2) may be presented by any patty as evidence on a due process complaint. 34
CFR §300.502. But for Attorney for the Board’s action of interrupting Ms. Bennett—Bigham to
ask that she give a summary of her ﬁndings only rather than details, there appeared to be no
substantive interaction or intent to consider the infonnation provided. (Finding of F act 86) This
denial of meaningful input resulted in a denial of FAPE, in that the bases for Student’s diagnosis
and the recommendations to remediate deﬁciencies having been rejected wholesale were not
implemented, thus delaying Student receiving the gap—ﬁlling direct instruction she needs.
Having provided no instruction to Student to remediate her basic reading and math calculation
deficits, the Board has also committed a substantive denial of a FAPE.

3. FAPE for the ESY in 2013 2014, 2015. Under the IDEA, ESY is deﬁned as special

education and related services that (1) are provided to a child with a disability (i) beyond the
normal school year of the public agency; (ii) in accordance with the child’s IEP; and (iii) at no
cost to the parents of the child and (2) meets the standards of the SEA. 34 CFR § 300.106 (b). As
a practical matter, Districts are not required to develop IEPs (with or without included ESY
sewices) for Students they have determined are not eligible for Special Education. When as in
this case, a student has not been not identiﬁed, analysis of this issue and all of the other ESY
issues, requires a determination of whether or not the District erred when it made its eligibility
determination. 1f the District’s decision not to identify the Student was appropriate, Student is
not entitled to ESY services and the analysis ends there. If the District erred by failing to identify
a Student, then an analysis of whether ESY sewices would have appropriately been on Student’s
IEP is the next step. The Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds that ESY would have been appropriate for at least
one year, based on the recommendations of Ms. Bennett—Bigham, and ﬁnds that since Student
didn’t receive any ESY programing there was a denial of FAPE for the years in question.
(Finding of Fact 55)

4. Child Find and Evaluation of Child in All Areas of Suspected Disability. The District did not
fail in its afﬁrmative duty to "find" the Student as eligible for Special Education and related
services under the IDEA (20 USC §1412(a) (3) and 34 CFR §300.111) Under the IDEA, a
request for an initial evaluation to determine whether a child is a student with a disability may be
initiated either the Parent or the District. 34 CFR §300.301(b). While the legislation and
regulations contemplate that a Parent may bring a child’s potential disability to the attention of a
District, the District has an independent, afﬁrmative and ongoing obligation, referred to

19

March 4, 2016 Final Decision and Order 15-0594/16—0011

generally and hereinafter as the “child ﬁnd” obligation, to identify students with disabilities. 20
USC §§1401 (3); 1412(a)(3); 34 CFR § 300.111; and R,C.S.A. §10—76d-7(c). The District’s child
ﬁnd duty is triggered when the local education agency ("LEA") has reason to suspect a disability,
and reason to suspect that special education services may be needed to address that disability.
Regional School District No. 9 Board ofEducation v. Mr. and Mrs. M, as Parents and Next
Friends ofMM a Minor Child 53 IDELR 8; 109 LRP 51058 (2009) U.S. District Court,
Connecticut; citing New Paltz Cenlral Sch. Dist. v, St. Pierre, 307 F. Supp. 2d 394, 400
O\I.D.N.Y. 2004). The District, initially at the initiative of its staff, and later at the request of
Parents, held multiple PPT meetings to determine Student’s eligibility for Special Education.
(Finding of Fact 4) The District over the course of Student’s enrollment conducted numerous
evaluations, even after initial evaluation request by Parent did not produce a diagnosis, and
Student’s progress in school was as far as the grades suggested was adequate. (Finding of Fact
14) As illustrated in Parents’ private evaluations, Student’s recent diagnosis presents itself
through a complex array of disparate scores across a variety of instruments. (F indings of Fact,
28—34) In such instances, a school’s failure to diagnose a disability at the earliest possible
moment is not per se actionable, especially in cases where a disability is difﬁcult to diagnose or
is the subject of controversy among experts (See A.P, ex rel. Powers v. Woodstock Bd. ofEduc.,
572 F. Supg. 2d 221, 226 (D. Conn. 2008). Given the number of evaluations conducted by
District staff and consultants and the number of PPT meetings that have been held to make
eligibility determinations for this Student, the Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds that the District has taken
reasonable steps to determine whether or not the Student had a disability and evaluated the
Student that areas it suspected Student might have a disability and as such the Board is in
compliance with its obligations under child ﬁnd.

5. Reimbursement for Dr. Heitzman’s and Patricia Bennett-Bigharn’s Evaluations and Tutoring.
Dr. Heitzman’s and Ms. Bennett—Bigham’s evaluations were not Independent Educational
Evaluations under the IDEA and thus Parents are not entitled to reimbursement for the costs of
the evaluations nor costs associated with attendance of evaluators at PPT meetings or
consultation. Pursuant to 20 USC §1415(b)(1) and (d)(2)(A) and 34 CFR §300.502, parents of a
child with a disability have the right to obtain an TEE at public expense if the parents disagree
with an evaluation obtained by the District, subject to certain conditions. Upon receipt of a
request for an IEE, the District has two options, it may either ﬁle a due process complaint to
request a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate; or ensure that an independent
educational eva1uation is provided at public expense. 34 CFR §300.502(b)(2)(3) 1f the District’s
evaluations are found at a due process hearing to be appropriate, Parents are entitled to a private
evaluation, but not at public expense. 34 CFR §300.502(b)(3)

The District’s right to due process as a means to defend its evaluation is codiﬁed in this
regulation, and as such Parents were required to notify the District of their disagreement with the
District’s evaluation before the obligation to reimburse the Parents attached. The record shows
that while two times IEE requests were made, both were subsequently withdrawn. At the June 4,
2013, PPT meeting Parents requested but then withdrew their request for an evaluation. (Finding
of Fact 78) On July 2, 2014, Parents withdrew their then pending request for an IEE. (Finding of
Fact 83) Where the evaluations were obtained in the absence of an expressed disagreement with
the District or Parents have withdrawn their request for an TEE, Parents are not entit1ed to seek
reimbursement under IDEA. Parents had requested IEEs on prior occasions, the ﬁrst request
having resulted in the District obtaining Dr. Mayville’s evaluation in 2010, demonstrating their
familiarity with the process, their decision to withdraw their request carried the attendant risk of

20

March 4, 2016 Final Decision and Order 15-0594/16-0011

ﬁnancial responsibility for same. The Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds that reimbursement for summer
tutoring might be ordered under compensatory education, but declines to make such an order for
the tutoring that was obtained was not conducted in the manner recommended by Parent’s
evaluators.

6. Dismissal of Issues 13-18. The Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds persuasive the guidance in Circular
Letter: C—l3, Series 2008-09, which states that a Hearing Ofﬁcer may address Section 504
claims, “...only as necessary to resolve the claims under the IDEA.” Circular Letter C—l3, Mark
McQuillan, Series 2008—2009 Reissue (May 20, 2009). This Hearing Ofﬁcer has already
engaged in an analysis of whether the resolution of any non-IDEA issues might be necessary to
decide any of the IDEA issues presented in her ruling on the Board’s Motion to Dismiss, which
resulted in the inclusion of issues 13 through 18 in the hearing. After an analysis of the evidence,
presented at the hearing, the Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds that is was not necessary to decide any of the
504 or ADA issues in order to decide the IDEA issues. Having found that there was a denial of
FAPE which entitled Student to relief under the IDEA, analysis of the Section 504 issues
presented in Parent’s request for a due process hearing was not required. Parents may pursue
such claims through the dispute resolution procedures offered under Section 504 and if aggrieved
by any portion of this decision will have exhausted their administrative remedies and free to
pursue those claims in Superior 01' Federal Court. Thus, issues 13—1 8 are dismissed.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

1. The issue of whether or not the evaluation conducted by the District was appropriate,

having been withdrawn by the Board, is hereby dismissed.

The District failed to provide Student with a FAPE for the ESY in the summer of 2013.

The District failed to provide Student with a FAPE for the 2013-2014 academic year.

The District failed to provide student with a FAPE for the ESY in the summer of 2014.

The District failed to provide Student with a FAPE for the 2014-2015 academic year.

The District failed to provide student with a FAPE for the ESY in the summer of 2015.

The District’s proposed program for the 2015—2016 school year fails to provide Student

with a FAPE.

8. The District did not fail to evaluate the Student in all areas of suspected disability under
the IDEA.

9. The District did not fail in its afﬁrmative duty to "ﬁnd" the Student as eligible for Special
Education and related services under the IDEA (20 U.S.C. Section 1412(a) (3) and 34
C.F.R. Section 300.11).

10. The District is not liable for the reimbursement to the Parents for the private tutoring
services to the Student under the IDEA.

l 1. The evaluations conducted by Dr. Heitzman and Patricia Bennett—Bigham at Parents’
expense were not Independent Educational Evaluations (TEE) under the IDEA and
therefore, Parents are not entitled to reimbursement and the Hearing Ofﬁcer declines to
order reimbursement pursuant to her authority under compensatory education.

13. Issues 13 through 18 are dismissed.

14. The District is ordered to immediately convene a PPT meeting and ﬁnd the Student
eligible for Special Education under the disability category of Speciﬁc Learning
Disabilities/Dyslexia and to develop an appropriate Individualized Educational Program

action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer. ‘
