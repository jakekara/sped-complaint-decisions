New Haven, Connecticut  06504   Appearing before:    Attorney Christine B. Spak, Hearing Officer 
         FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUES:  1. Is the program offered by the board appropriate to meet the student&#8482;s unique needs in 
that the transition will not cause him to regress educationally, socially and 
emotionally? 
 2. If not, is the current program that the student is enrolled in appropriate to meet his 
needs.  SUMMARY:  The student is twelve years old and is currently enrolled at ACES Mill Road School(hereinafter ACES) in a highly structured, self-contained setting.  His identification since first grade has been seriously emotionally disturbed and he has been 

in the ACES program since second grade.  The student has made academic and 
behavioral gains at ACES.  His local school district has determined that the student 
should be educated in a setting that while still structured and self-contained they believe 
is less restrictive. The parent has requested due process to allow the student to remain in 
his present educational program believing that he is not ready for transition to the new 
program.
