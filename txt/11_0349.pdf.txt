concerning communications to the Parties from the Hearing Ofﬁcer:

the decision date was extended to May 26, 201 1, and again extended to June 25, 2011,
The hearing convened on May 27, 201 l. The hearing was adjourned to provide time for
Parents to meet with the Psychologist who had evaluated the Student and, if necessary,
attend another Planning and Placement Team (PPT) meeting.

On May 31, 201 1, Parents requested an independent evaluation because they disagreed
with the Board’s evaluation. The Board refused to fund such an evaluation, and
requested a hearing as required by 34 CFR § 300.502 (b) (2) (i) This Hearing Ofﬁcer was
assigned case 11—0514.

By email dated Jilly 13, 201 1, Parents wrote:
Please notice that In order to process with a formal legal action, we are going to
drop this pending case. Thanks.
The Board’s Attorney responded, asking for more details and reminding them that the
Board had ﬁled the second case and would not withdraw that unless Parents withdrew
their request for an independent evaluation.

The Hearing Ofﬁcer also responded to the Parent on July .13, 201 1:
Dear [Parent]:
Am 1 correct that you are withdrawing your request for a special education
hearing, which is Case number 1 1—0349?

Case #1 1-0514 was requested by the [ ] Board of Education. As Attorney
Moses has explained in her email, this case will go foxward unless the Board
withdraws its request for a hearing.

The decision date was again extended, to July 30, 201 1. On June 20, 201 l, the Parents
requested that the hearing scheduled for July 1 1 be postponed until “sometime in mid
August”, The Hearing Ofﬁcer responded on July 21, 201 1, that another extension ol‘the
decision date would be required and offered three dates in August. The Parents
responded the same day, “That is ﬁne with me.” The Hearing Ofﬁcer extended the
decision date to August 29, 201 1.

By email dated July 18, 2011, the Hearing Ofﬁcer summarized the history of the case, i
concluding:
I have not received a response from you to my July 13 [201 1] email. Ifl do not
hear from you before July 22, 2011, I will be DISMISSING case #1 1-0349

without prejudice.

 

July 26, 201 1 —3- Final Decision and Order I 1—0349

All motions and objections not previously ruled upon, if any, are hereby overruled.

SUMMARY :

The Parents requested a full—day program for their three—year—old son, who had been
diagnosed as having autism. The Board arranged for an evaluation by a psychologist
who conﬁrmed serious developmental delays. The Psychologist’s report suggested a
longer school day to accommodate intensive speech/language therapy. The Parents
disagreed, continuing their request for a full day program and a full day extended year
program.

In order to comply with the conﬁdentiality requirements 01‘ the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of I974, 20 U.STC. § 1232g and related regulations at 34 C.F.R. §
99, the following decision uses “Student”, “School”, “Parent” and titles of school staff
members and other witnesses in place of names and other personally identiﬁable
information.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:

Section 10-76h, Connecticut General Statutes (C.G.S.), and related regulations at Section
10-76h, Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, authorize an impartial hearing ofﬁcer
to conduct a special education hearing and to render a ﬁnal decision in accordance with
Sections 4—176e through 4-180a, inclusive, and Sections 4—181a of the C.G.S. Section 20
U.S.C. § 1415(1) and related regulations at 34 C.F.R. § 300.511 through § 300.520 also
authorize special education hearings.

Because the second case involving the Board and this family, Case No. 1 1—514, was
initiated by the Board, it will continue unless the Board withdraws their request for
hearing.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
The Parents having made an ambiguous request to withdraw their request for hearing and

having failed to respond to inquiries requesting more information, Case No. 11-0349 is
DISMISSED without prejudice.
