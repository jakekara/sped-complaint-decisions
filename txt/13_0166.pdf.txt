ISSUES:

2. If the answer to Question 1 is no, then should the board be required to follow the

PROCEDURAL HISTORY/ SUMMARY:

Parents initiated a Request for Due Process Hearing on October 3, 2012. The mailing date of the
Final Decision and Order is December 17, 2012. A preheating conference was conducted on
October 30, 2012. At the telephonic Prehearing Conference on October 30, 2012, the Parents
raised an issue of a recent change of placement of Student in that the Board was no longer
delivering speech and language services as required by Student’s Individualized Education
Program (“IEP”). The Hearing Ofﬁcer scheduled and conducted a pendency hearing on this issue
in accordance with 34 CPR. {$300518 on November 16, 2012. After the hearing, the Hearing
Ofﬁcer issued 21 Stay Put Order pursuant to 34 CFR. §3001518. The Hearing Ofﬁcer issued a
Notice of Additional Hearing Dates for December 6, 12 and 14, 2012.

On November 30, 2012, the Board’s attorney requested a postponement of the hearing and
cancellation of the December 6, 2012 hearing date because the parties had arrived at an
agreement that had not yet been completely negotiated and executed. The parents had no
objection. The Board’s request for postponement was denied as untimely under state
regulations.

The hearing convened on December 6, 2012. At the hearing, the Parents requested a withdrawal
of their Request for Hearing with prejudice.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED with prejudice.
