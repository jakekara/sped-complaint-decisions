y. Christine B. Spak, Hearing Officer      FINAL DECISION  
 The prehearing conference in this matter was held on September 18, 2006 and the Board was not 
available to participate.  The factual basis underlying this action was the allegation that an assault had occurred in school. A hearing date was set and the parties convened.  The Board filed a Motion to Dismiss.  The Student did not comp
ly with a number of procedural requirements 
including the five day rule, appeared through counsel at hearing without witnesses and was in general not prepared to go forward with this matter.  The Student&#8482;s
 main concern appeared to be 
the need to exhaust administrative remedies in re
gard to a civil suit they were pursuing. It was noted as of this date there is not a statute of limitations problem in regard to IDEA and that the 
dismissal without prejudice would 
allow the Student to re-file if such was deemed necessary at a 
later date and done in a timely manner so as 
not to go beyond the special education due process statute of limitations.  
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
  The hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
