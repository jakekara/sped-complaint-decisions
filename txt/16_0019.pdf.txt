November 16, 2015 Final Decision and Order Case No. 16-0019

At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program provided by the
Board for the 201 5 —2016 school year. The Parents requested placement of the Student at Thames
Academy. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On July 13, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The Student was
over the age of eighteen and had appointed his Parents to proceed on his behalf. The parties agreed to
forego a resolution session and proceed to mediation. The mediation date was pending.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on July 10, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was held on
July 15, 2015. In an electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney informed the hearing ofﬁcer that the
matter was resolved but additional time was needed to ratify the agreement. In an electronic
transmission the Parents’ attorney withdrew the matter with prejudice. The date for the mailing of the
F inal Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the hearing date and the ratiﬁcation of the
agreement. The date for mailing the F inal Decision and Order is November 24, 2015.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals ﬁom the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
