., M.A. (Clinical Psychology), Hearing Officer FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
This matter was commenced by request for due pr
ocess dated June 22, 2009 (the &#64257;Request&#64258;), sent by overnight delivery, addressed to the District (via its attorney, Ms. Mose
s) and copied to the Connecticut Department of Education (&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;), Bureau of Sp
ecial Education Due Process Unit.  The undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer on July 9, 2009.  By agreement, 
a telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) was convened on August 3, 2009. Each party pa
rticipated through counsel (Mr. Perzin for the Parents and Ms. Moses for the Board). 
The Parents allege that the District denied the Student a free and appropriate public education 
(&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) with respect to extended school year services (&#64257;ESY&#64258;) in the summer of 2007, to ESY in the 
summer of 2008, to the 2008/2009 school year, to ESY in the summer of 2009, and to the 2009/2010 school year. The Parents unilaterally placed the Stude
nt out-of-district in the summer of 2007, in the 

2008/2009 school year, and in the summer of 2009, and are placing her out-of-district for the 2009/2010 school year, and contend that the District is obligated to fund those placements.  The Parents also seek 
reimbursement for an evaluation performed in 
2007, and for a more recent evaluation.  The 2007/2008 
school year is not at issue in this hearing.  The parties do not dispute the Student&#8482;s eligibility classification based on an autism spectrum disorder (&#64257;ASD&#64258;), but disa
gree over the additional eligibility classification of 

Serious Emotional Disturbance (&#64257;SED&#64258;) that was assi
gned to the Student during the period starting with the summer of 2008.   
At the PHC the parties reported that they have agreed to pursue a CTDOE-facilitated mediation as 
a means of attempting to resolve thei
r dispute and in lieu of a resolution session.  No sufficiency challenge was filed, and the Board, at the Hearing Officer&#8482;s direction, filed an answer to the Request on August 10, 2009. By agreement of the parties, a scheduling orde
r was issued dated August 3, 2009 which defined a schedule for pre-hearing and hearing procedures that would permit the pa
rties an opportunity to pursue a
