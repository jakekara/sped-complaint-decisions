 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES SET FOR HEARING  1. Whether and to what extent the Parents are entitled to reimbursement for the 
Student&#8482;s placement at Devereux Glenholme (&#64257;Devereux&#64258;) in the 2004/2005 school year. 
 2. Whether and to what extent the Parents are entitled to reimbursement for the 
Student&#8482;s placement at Devereux in the 2005/2006 school year. 
 PROCEDURAL MATTERS  A. Procedural History 
  The Parents commenced this proceeding by letter to Regional School District No. 9 

(the &#64257;District&#64258;) dated December 2, 2005 and received by the Department of Education 

(&#64257;DOE&#64258;) on December 7, 2005.  No sufficiency challenge was asserted and the parties did 

not timely convene a resolution meeting.  A pre-hearing conference convened on January 12, 

2006, at which a February 15, 2006 initial hearing date and February 21, 2006 date for 
issuance of the final decision and order was established.  The parties agreed to participate in 
a DOE-sponsored mediation and both the initial hearing date and date for issuance of the 

final decision and order were continued to accommodate a March 16, 2006 mediation session 

which ultimately proved unsuccessful.  By agreement of the parties, the date for issuance of a 

final decision and order was extended to June 30, 2006 and hearing convened on May 1st , 4th  and 23rd  and June 5th and 6th.   The evidentiary record was closed on June 6, 2006 and post-hearing briefs were submitted on June 30, 2006.  Given the timing of that filing, the Hearing 

Officer extended the date for issuance of the final decision and order until July 10, 2006.
