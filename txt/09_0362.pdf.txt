FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
: This matter was heard as a contested
 case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes (CGS) &#167;10-76h and related 
regulations, 20 United States Code&#167;1415(f) and relate
d regulations, and in accordance with the Uniform Administration Procedures Act, CGS &#167;&#167;4-176e to 
4-178, inclusive, and 4-181a and 4-186. 
The Student is a 16 year and 11 months old man who has 
been identified with Specific Learning Disability and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public educati
on (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connectic
ut General Statute &#167;10-76a. At the January 6, 2009 
PPT meeting, the Parents requested that the Student be placed at Kildonan School. The Board denied the Parents&#8482; 

request and the Parents requested due process. The Board 
received notice of the request for due process on March 18, 
2009 and the parties opted to go to mediation rather than 
a resolution meeting. At the mediation session of June 12, 
2009, the parties failed to reach an agreement.
