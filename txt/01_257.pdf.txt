Wethersfield Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parents: Attorney Howard Klebanoff      Corporate Center West      433 South Main Street &#338; Suite 102      West Hartford, Connecticut 06110  Appering on behalf of the Board: Attorney Susan Freedman      Shipman & Goodwin, LLC      One American Row      Hartford, Connecticut 06103-2819  Appearing before:   Attorney Christine B. Spak, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   SUMMARY:   The issues in this matter included a placement in an out of district school. The prehearing was held on August 1, 2001 and the parties agreed to a hearing date of September 21, 2001. On September 14, 2001 the Board&#8482;s counsel extended the courtesy to the hearing officer of letting her know by letter that the parties had reached an agreement that had not yet been reduced to writing. The purpose of the letter was to give the hearing officer as much notice as possible that the September 21, 2001 hearing date would not be needed. On September 17, 2001 the Student&#8482;s counsel informed the hearing officer that the parties were &#64257;in the process of executing a settlement agreement&#64258; and offered to withdraw the matter without prejudice or, if the hearing officer was willing to grant a one week continuance the matter would be withdrawn with prejudice. The matter was continued until October 4, 2001 and the parties were informed by written notice that it would be dismissed with prejudice if it was not withdrawn by that date. A new mailing date of November 19, 2001 was set.  The hearing officer has heard nothing more in this matter so it is concluded that the settlement agreement must have been finalized to the satisfaction of both parties.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:   The hearing is dismissed with prejudice.
