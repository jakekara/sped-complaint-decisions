Final Decision and Order
w
1. Whether the District had a basis ofknowledge that the student was a child with a
disability prior to the incident on November 1, 201 1;
2. Whether the Hearing Ofﬁcer has jurisdiction to hear this matter;
3. Should the matter be dismissed for the Parent’s failure to attend the resolution

meeting.

Procedural History:

This matter is before the Hearing Ofﬁcer pursuant to the Request for Due Process
hearing, ﬁled by the Parent and received by the Board on December 16, 201 1.

The initial request for Due Process disagreed that the child’s behavior was not a
manifestation of his disability, as found by a PPT (Planning and Placement Team) meeting held
on December 5, 20] 1‘ The Parent was disputing the proposed “full 180” expulsion other child

that was to be determined at an expulsion hearing to be held on December 20, 201 l. The

January 27,2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0215

resolution sought by the Parent was for the school to “change my child’s IEP [Individualized
Education Program], not expel him”.

A pre-hearing conference was held on December 21, 2011, which included the Parent and
Mary Acquarulo, Director of Student Services, East Haven Public Schools, to discuss the issues
For the Due Process Hearing. At that pre-eonference hearing it was determined that at the time 01‘
the incident on November 1, 201 1, the student had neither an IEP nor a §504 plan in place. A
§504 plan was put into place pursuant to a meeting held with the Parent and the school on
December 5, 2011, ﬁnding the student eligible for §504 services. Subsequent to the §504
eligibility meeting and on the same day, a manifestation hearing was held in which it was
determined that the behavior in question was not a manifestation of the child’s disability (chronic
lumbar strain, right/leﬁ pes planovalgus food deformities, patello femoral pain syndrome), The
District voiced objection to a due process hearing, citing that this hearing ofﬁcer did not have
jurisdiction to hear a §504 due process complaint. The Parent stated that she was claiming an
IDEA violation (Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act), Interim orders were
issued were the Parent was instructed to ﬁle an amended complaint by January 5, 2012 to more
accurately reﬂect her complaint, and the District was instructed that their objection would be
treated as a Motion to Dismiss, requiring a formal motion and Memorandum of Law in support
ot‘that motion. A due process hearing date was set 1‘01~ January 13, 2012,

On December 22, 2012 the District requested the Parent to attend a resolution meeting
scheduled either for that day, or the following day, December 23, 2012. The Parent did not
attend although the reasons for that are in dispute between the palties, and the District held the

resolution meeting on December 22, 2012 without the Parent.

January 27, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0215

Due to questions raised by the District’s counsel concerning the Interim Orders, on
December 27, 2011, the Hearing Ofﬁcer issued a Clariﬁcation of Interim Orders, providing that
the District would have until January 10, 2012 to provide the Motion to Dismiss and
Memorandum of Law, A motion by the District to delay the due process hearing scheduled for
January 13, 2012 was denied.

The Parent ﬁled an Amended Complaint on January 1, 2012, along with over one
hundred exhibits. The Amended Complaint set forth a plethora of issues citing violations of state
and federal laws and regulations Key among those issues were violations of Child Find,
procedural violations under IDEA, violations of 34 CPR. 300534 with a basis of knowledge by
the District and a failure by the District to provide the procedural safeguard notices relevant
under both state and federal laws. The complaint further states Violations of the East Haven
Board of Education policies surrounding procedural issues when expulsion of a student is being
sought.

On January 9, 2012, the District requested a second preheating conference be convened
to clarify the issues presented in the Amended Complaint. A second preheating conference was
held on January 1 1, 2012. The palties agreed that the issues to be discussed at the January 13,
2012 hearing would be restricted to jurisdiction, and pending the resolution of that issue, the
resolution meeting. The District renewed its Motion to Dismiss for lack ofjurisdictlon, and
further that the complaint should be dismissed because the Parent did not attend the resolution
meeting. It was further agreed by the parties that should jurisdiction be found, the resulting
hearing process would proceed along a normal, and not expedited, hearing track. On January 13,

2012 a hearing was convened with witnesses and exhibits presented by both partiest

January 27,2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0215

Summaﬂ:

The student is 17 years of age, with an academic standing of a sophomore, but in his third
year of high school. The student was involved in the unauthorized transfer of his personal
medication to another student, during school hours and on school property, on the afternoon of
November 1, 201 1‘ Subsequent to being informed by an uninvolved student that the student had
provided another student with his medication that was then ingested, an investigation by the
District ensued, The results of that investigation led to a recommendation for expulsion of the
student for violating a publicized District policy. The Parent requested a PPT meeting but the
District indicated that it would not hold a PPT as the student was not identiﬁed as receiving
special education at that time; the District was, however, willing to hold an eligibility meeting on
December 5, 201 1. The District conducted no evaluations of the student but did consider an IEP
from May 2007. That IEP exited the student from special education sewices. The student was
found to be a child with a disability with a resulting placement ot‘the student on an
accommodation plan in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 1973 (§504 plan),
Immediately following the eligibility meeting the District held a Manifestation Determination
hearing to determine if the behavior in question was related to the student’s disability. It was
determined by the {$504 team that the behavior in question was not a manifestation of the
disability. The District then scheduled a December 20, 201 1 meeting, held an expulsion hearing
in accordance with District policy and the student was subsequently expelled from the East
Haven High School. Prior to the expulsion hearing, the Parent requested an expedited evaluation
of the student. On December 14, 201 1 the Parent ﬁled a request for a due process complaint; the
complaint was received by the District on December 16, 201 1. The District disagreed that the

complaint should be an expedited hearing 01‘ that it should be heard under IDEA.

evaluation pursuant to §§ 300.300 through 300.31 1, for eligibility for special education 01‘
related services on 01‘ prior to, November 1, 201 1. (Test. Student, record)

The District was aware of the excessive absenteeism 01‘ the student by way of their own

supervising personnel, were aware ()fthe student’s pattern of behavior and resulting

effect on the student’s ability to receive a free and appropriate education.

Conclusions of Law:

1. CGS §10~76h and related regulations at RCSA §10~76h (Regulations of Connecticut
State Agencies), authorize an impartial hearing officer to conduct a special education
hearing and to render a ﬁnal decision in accordance with §§ 4'176e through 4-180a,
inclusive, and § 4—181a ol‘the CGS, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(0 and related regulations at 34
CFR §§300.51 1 through 300.520 also authorize special education hearings.

2, IDEA opens the door of public education to children with disabilities, Board of Educ. Of
the Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch, Dist. v. Rowley, 458 US. 176, 192 (1982). Under
IDEA, a local education agency (LEA), such as the District, must provide to each
qualifying student a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE) including special education and related services. 20 U.S.C.
§1401(18).

3. The purpose of IDEA is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them
FAPE that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their
unique needs and to prepare them for further education. employment and independent
living and to “ensure that the rights ot‘children with disabilities and parents of such

children are protected ...” 20 U.S.C. §1400 (d)(1).

January 27,2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0215

4. Under the IDEA, all public education agencies are also required to satisfy their “Child
Find” obligation through policies and procedures that ensure that: “All children with
disabilities residing in the state, including children who are homeless or wards of the state
and children with disabilities attending private schools, regardless oflhe severity ofrheir
disability, and who are in need of special education and related sewices, are identiﬁed,
located and evaluated and a practical method is developed and implemented to determine
which children are currently receiving needed special education and related services.”
[emphasis added] 20 U.S.C. §l4l2(a)(3)(A)‘ Child Find duty extends to all children
suspected of having a disability and in need of special education under 34 CPR. §300.8
even though they are advancing from grade to grade. 34 C‘F.Ri §300,1 1(c)(l). The duty
is triggered when the local education agency has reason to suspect a disability and reason
to suspect that special education services may be needed to address that disability. New
Palrz Central Sch, Disl. v. St. Pierre, 307 Supp‘ 2d 394, 400 (N.D.N.Y. 2004). In relation
to this case, no evidence was presented by the District that the student was evaluated
within the past four years for identiﬁcation for special education and related services.

The District did offer as an exhibit an IEP (exh. B—l) exiting the student from special
education and related services and containing a triennial evaluation dated May 29, 2007.
There were no other evaluations submitted by the District in relation to this student for
the time period in question

5. “Special education” means “speciﬁcally designed instruction at no cost to parents to meet
the unique needs ofa child with a disability.” 20 U.S.C. §1401(25).

6. “Related services” means: transportation, and such developmental, corrective, and other

supportive services (including speech/language pathology and audiology services,

10

January 27, 2012 Finat Decision and Order 12'0215

psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, recreation, including
therapeutic recreation, social work services, orientation and mobility services, and
medical services, except that such medical sewices can be for diagnostic and evaluation
purposes only) as may be required to assist a child with a disability to beneﬁt from
special education, including the early identiﬁcation and assessment of disabling
conditions in children. 20 USC. §1401(22)t

7. The standard for determining whether FAPE has been provided involves a hvo-px'onged
inquiry: have the procedural requirements of IDEA been reasonably met, and, second, is
the IEP “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational beneﬁts.”
Board ofEduc. Oflhe Hendrick Hudson Central Sch, Dist, v. Rowley, 458 US. 176, 206—
7 (1982), The District did not offer any evidence that the educational 0pp01tunity
afforded the student was appropriate 01' was conveying educational beneﬁt. There was
evidence submitted that there was little to no educational beneﬁt derived by the student in
that he was receiving a ﬂunking grade on seven out of nine classes, a “D” in one class,
and not participating at all in the ninth class (physical education). However, neither the
lack of evidence in support for the educational program provided, nor the evidence of the
student’s lack ot‘passing is determinative of anything without proper evaluations upon
which to gauge the student’s performance One cannot determine if the lack ofattaining
a passing grade is due to a lack ot‘a proper educational program on the District’s part, an
undiagnosed special education need, or a lack ot‘motivalion and effort on the students‘
part.

8. RCSA §10—76d-6 provides in relevant part: “Determination ofa child’s eligibility to

receive special education and related services shah be based on documented evidence, as

11

January 27,2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0215

required by these regulations, that the child requires special education.” RCSA §10—76d-7
provides in relevant part: “Before a child is referred to a planning and placement team,
alternative procedures and programs in regular education shall be explored and, where
appropriate, implemented.” There was 110 evidence presented at the January 13, 2012
hearing that the District had explored or offered any alternative procedure or program in
regular education to address the documented evidence that the student had excessive
absences and was failing all of his academic classes. The testimony of both guidance
counselors showed that the District chose to ﬁle a Family with Service Needs (“FWSN”)
referral to the J uvenile Court prior to having a meeting with the student and Parent. A
FWSN is not an alternative procedure or program in regular education.

9. RCSA 10—76d(a)(1) provides in relevant part: “In accordance with the regulations and
procedures established by the Commissioner 01‘ Education and approved by the State
Board of Education, each local or regional board 01‘ education shall provide the
professional services requisite to identiﬁcation ofchildren requiring special education,
identify each such child within itsjurisdiction, determine the eligibility of such children
for special education pursuant to sections 10-762) to 10—76h, inclusive”? This
regulation is the equivalent state mandate for child ﬁnd in accordance with IDEA. To
fulﬁll the requirements for §§ 10-76d-6 and 10—76d-7, it is axiomatic that §10—76d(a)(l)
must be satisﬁed The District offered no evidence, short oi‘a four year old Triennial
evaluation, that it had attempted to, 01' had evaluated the student prior to the tiling ot‘the
FWSN, despite being aware of the excessive absences, medical issues, and loss of credits

for the student,

12

January 27,2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0215

10. 34 CFR §300.534 Protections for children not yet eligible for special education and
related services states:
(a) GeneraL A child who has not been determined to be eligible for special education and
related services under this palt and who has engaged in behavior that violated a code of
student conduct, may asseit any of the protections provided for in this pant if the public
agency had knowledge (as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section)
that the child was a child with a disability before the behavior that precipitated the
disciplinary action occurred.
(b) Basis ot'knowledge. A public agency must be deemed to have knowledge that a child
is a child with a disability if before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action
occurred:

(1) The parent of the child expressed concern in writing to supervisory or
administrative personnel of the appropriate educational agency, 01' a teacher of the child,
that the child is in need et‘special education and related services;

(2) The parent of the child requested an evaluation ot‘the child pursuant to 300.300
through 3003] 1; 01'

(3) The teacher 01‘ the child, or other personnel ot‘ the LEA, expressed speciﬁc concerns
about a pattern of behavior demonstrated by the child directly to the director ofspeciai
education of the agency or to other supervisory personnel ot‘thc agency.

The student qualiﬁed to be afforded the protection under IDEA in accordance with 34 C.F.Rt
300.534.’I‘he parent has satisﬁed the third prong of 34 C.F.R. 300.534 in that the District is
found to have had a basis of knowledge that a pattern of behavior (the excessive absences,

failing grades and loss of credits) demonstrated by the child had been expressed specificall y

13

 

January 27,2012 Final Decision and Order 12—0215

11.

by the teacher or other personnel of the LEA (guidance counselor Hoeﬂich) directly to other
supervisory personnel of the agency (asst. Vice principal Proto) so that the student should
have been evaluated to determine eligibility to receive special education or related services.
Procedural safeguards are set forth in 20 U.S.C. §i415 and C.F.R. §§ 300500 er seq.

Failure by the Board to develop an IEP in accordance with procedures mandated by IDEA, in
and oi‘itself, can be deemed a denial of FAPE. Amanda .1. ex rel Annette J. v. Clark Cozmly
Sch Dist 267 F.3d 877, 9'h Cir (2001). In matters alleging a procedural violation, a hearing
ofﬁcer may ﬁnd that a child did not receive a free and appropriate public education only if
the procedural inadequacies: (I) impeded the child’s right to a free and appropriate public
education; (11) signiﬁcantly impeded the parent’s opportunity to participate in the decision—
makjng process regarding the provision oi‘a free and appropriate public education to the
parent’s child; 01' (111) caused a deprivation ol‘educationai beneﬁts. (iii) Rule ofeonstruction.
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude a hearing officer from ordering a
local educational agency to comply with procedural requirements under this subsection. 20
U.S.Ct §i415(f)(3)(E); 34 C.F.R. §300i513. “Only procedural inadequacies that cause
substantial harm to the child or his parents ~ meaning that the individual or cumulative result
is the loss of educational opportunity 01‘ seriously infringe on a parent’s participation in the
creation or formulation of the IEP ~ constitute a denial ofFAPE,” Mafrejek v, Brewster Cenl.
Sch. Dist. 471 F.Supp 415, 419 (S.DtN.Y. 2007) Given that the District did not attempt to
obtain evaluations of the student for either an Oithotic impairment necessitating special
education or related services, not evaluations based on the total failure in all classes offered
and the excessive absences but instead chose to refer the child for Juvenile Court

involvement for truancy despite its knowledge Ofthese issues, it is found that the District

14

 

January 27, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0215

12.

committed procedural inadequacies that caused a loss of educational opportunity for this
student. These inadequacies resulted in the denial of FAPE for this student.

34 C.F.R. 300.510(2)(b)(4) allows that if “the LEA is unable to obtain the participation of
the parent in the resolution meeting aﬁer reasonable efforts have been made (and
documented using the procedures in §300‘322(d)), the LEA may, at the conclusion ofthe 30-
day period, request that a hearing officer dismiss the parent‘s due process complaint.” The
District is required to hold a resolution meeting within seven (7) days ofreceipt 0f the
complaint. 34 C.F.R. 300.506. The District notiﬁed the Parent on December 22, 201 1, the
sixth day, of a resolution meeting to be held either that day, or the next day. The Parent
stated on the record but not through direct testimony that she was under the belief that the
hearing ofﬁcer had stated that the resolution meeting was not required and for that reason she
did not attend, also stating that she was unable to attend regardless. Given that there was less
than 24 hours notice for the meeting to be held on December 22, 201 ] which is not
considered by the hearing officer to be “reasonable”, and the mistaken beliefofthe Parent
that the resolution meeting was not required, the hearing ofﬁcer elects not to dismiss the
matter and the request of the District to dismiss the matter for the Parent’s failure to attend
the resolution meeting is denied.

Final Decision and Order

It is therefore ordered that:

1. The District’s Motion to Dismiss is denied.
2. The District will conduct an expedited evaluation(s) ol‘ the student to determine the
student’s eligibility to receive special education or related services in accordance with the

procedural requirements of IDEA.

January 27, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12—0215

3. Upon completion of the evaluation process and dependent upon a ﬁnding ot‘a disability
warranting special education services, the District will create an appropriate
Individualized Education Program (IEP)

4‘ Following the creation of an appropriate IEP, ifone is so created, the District will
convene a manifestation determination hearing to assess if the behavioral incident of
November 1, 201 1 is a manifestation of the child’s disability as outlined in the ER

5. During the pendency of the evaluation, and in consideration of the seriousness of the
alleged incident, the possible creation ot‘an IEP and resulting manifestation
determination hearing, the student will be provided appropriate homebound instruction,
for his protection and the protection ofother students, in accordance with the provision of

a free and appropriate public education.
