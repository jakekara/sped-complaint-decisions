FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Whether the Board offered the Student an appropriate program for ESY 10 and the 2010-

11 school year;
2. If not, whether the Parents’ placement of the Student at Maplebrook is appropriate;

3. Whether the Board’s actions in the scheduling of the PPT and the evaluations were
procedural violations which resulted in a denial of FAPE to the Student;
4. Whether the Student is entitled to compensatory education.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:

This request for hearing was received by the Board on December 27, 2010. A preheating
conference convened on January 12, 2011. The initial mailing date was extended so that the
parties could proceed with mediation. On March 11, prior to the ﬁrst hearing date, the Parents’
attorney submitted notiﬁcation that the mediation date scheduled for March 14 had been
cancelled by the Department of Education and was being rescheduled for a later date.

Based on this rescheduling the Parents’ attorney submitted a request that the case be withdrawn
without prejudice, and reported that the Board’s attorney had no objection to this request. This
matter will be dismissed without prejudice.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED, without prejudice.
