 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 
ISSUES 
 
 1. Did the Board deny a free appropria
te public education (FAPE) to the 
Student for the 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 school years, including the 2007 

and 2008 extended school years (&#64257;ESY&#64258;), in that it failed to provide an appropriate, 
intensive program based on hi
s individual needs or designed to result in meaningful 
educational benefit and provide him with sk
ills necessary to access his education and 
become more independent? 

 
 2. Did the Board violate the Pa
rents&#8482; procedural safeguards? 
 
 3. If so, should the Board be required to residentially place the Student for 

the 2008-2009 school year at the Bancroft School in New Jersey? 
 
 4. If the Student was not offered a FAPE for any or all of these school years, 

is the Board financially responsible for reimbursing the Parents for all expenses they incurred for those school years, including the Bancroft School and related services? 

 
 5. Are the Parents entitled to compensa
tory education as 
a remedy for past 
deprivations of FAPE and procedural violations?
