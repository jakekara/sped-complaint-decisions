 A special education hearing in the above-captioned matter was requested by the Student via

l decision and order was July 5, 2009. A pre-hearing conference was held on May 14, 2009. Attorney Jennifer Laviano appeared on 
behalf of the Student and Attorney Anne Littlefiel

1. Whether the Board of Education has an appropriate autism program available to Student

2. If the Board of Education does not have an appropriate autism program available to Student 
within the District, must the Student be placed ou

mediation. The request was granted after full considerat
