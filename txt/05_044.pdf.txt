  FINAL ORDER AND DECISION  ISSUES:  Should the Board be responsible for the cost of an independent psychological evaluation of the student as requested by the Parent? 
 SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  The student is a 17 years-old young man who has been identified as student requiring 

special education and related services as defined in Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. The Parent at a PPT meeting on or about 
February 11, 2005 requested an independent psychological evaluation of the student at the Board&#8482;s expense. The Board refused the 
Parent&#8482;s request and in accordance with the provisions of 34 C.F.R. &#167;300.502(b)(2) the 
Board requested a Due Process Hearing. On or about February 18, 2005, a hearing officer was appointed and a pre-hearing conference was held on March 8, 2005. At the pre-hearing conference the Parent requested another PPT in order to try and resolve the matter. The Board agreed to another 
PPT which was scheduled for March 30, 2005 and again for April 26, 2005. The final order and decision date was extended to June 6, 2005 in order for the parties to 
resolve the matter and if no resolution was possible, hearing dates be convened. 
In a letter received from the Board, the Hearing Officer was informed that the Parent 

withdrew their request for an independent psychological evaluation and the Board, 
THEREFORE was withdrawing their request for a Due Process Hearing. FINAL ORDER AND DECISION: THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
