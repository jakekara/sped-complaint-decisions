 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 ISSUE:  I. Whether the Student&#8482;s IEP provides for an a
ppropriate program in the least restrictive 
environment? 
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY/SUMMARY:
    The Parent requested a Due Process hearing on Nove
mber 24, 2008.  The matter was assigned to the 
hearing officer on November 28, 2008.  The Parent made
 two claims. The Student is denied an appropriate 
program in the least restrictive environment.  The second claim was resolved in a previous settlement and is 
not an issue for the hearing. The hearing convened on
 January 16, 2009, January 29, 2009, and January 30, 
2009.  On March 24, 2009, the Parent stated she wanted to withdraw from the hearing. The Board objected. 
The hearing scheduled for February 27, 2009, was post
poned, until March 6, 2009. On March 6, 2009, the 
parties requested a thirty day continuance to allow tim
e to pursue resolution to the dispute. The request was 
granted. The Attorney for the Board 
reported the parties were unable to 
resolve the dispute and offered three 
dates to reconvene the hearing. The Parent did not 
respond to the Board&#8482;s communication or offer dates she 
would be available for hearing. One week later, two 
dates, April 17, 2009 and May 18, 2009, were assigned 
for hearing. When the dates were assigned, the Parent 
did not communicate that she would not be available on 
the two assigned dates. The dates were selected to allo
w time between hearing days to avoid problems with 
the Parent&#8482;s work schedule. The Parent later notified 
the hearing officer by phone message she would not be 
able to attend the hearing on April 17, 2009.  The Parent&#8482;s request to postpone the hearing was not granted. 

The Board objected to a continuance of the hearing.  Pr
ior to the hearing, the Board filed a Motion for Entry 
of Judgment in the matter, which they argued on April 
17, 2009, in the Parent&#8482;s absence. The Parent received 
copies of the motion and was provided an opportunity to 
respond to the Board&#8482;s request.  The Parent objected 
to Entry of Judgment. She was then given the opport
unity to appear at the scheduled hearing on May 18,
