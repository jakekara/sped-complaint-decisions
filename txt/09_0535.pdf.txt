 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  This matter was commenced by a letter entitle
d &#64257;Request for Impartial Special Education 
Hearing&#64258; dated June 19, 2009, supplemented by a 
filing dated June 22, 2009 (collectively, the &#64257;Request&#64258;).  The undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer on June 24, 2009.   Assuming that 
the Request was received on June 22, 2009, the date for mailing of the Final Decision and Order 
would have been September 4, 2009.  
The Request states that Attorney
 Pollak has been retained both by the Student and his parents (the &#64257;Parents&#64258;), that this due process hearing is being commenced
 by the Student and the Parents, 
and that in the 2009/2010 school year the Student turned 18 years of age and was a senior attending the Board&#8482;s public high school.   The Request states further that the Student and Parents have also 
commenced, by a filing dated June 17, 2009, a &#64257;complaint&#64258; proceeding with the Connecticut 

Department of Education (&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;) Bureau of Speci
al Education.   That filing was not put before 
this Hearing Officer and counsel for the Board states that neither she nor her client has seen the June 17, 2009 complaint.    
The Board on July 6, 2009 filed a motion to dismiss and, in the alternative, a sufficiency challenge.                                                    1 In prior communications, the Hearing 
Officer had incorrectly identified the respondent board of education as 
the Westport Board of Education, when in fact the respondent is the Weston Board of Education.
