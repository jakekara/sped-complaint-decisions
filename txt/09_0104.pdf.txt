 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
 (November 26, 2008) 
 
This matter was commenced by reques
t for due process dated August 26, 2008 and received by the Board on August 28, 2008.  Accordingly, absent modification by the 
Hearing Officer, the date for mailing of the 
Final Decision and Order would have been 
November 12, 2008.  The August 26, 2008 request for due process, as amended on 

October 20, 2008, asserts claims of a denial 
of FAPE within the meaning of the  
Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400, 
et. seq. (the &#64257;IDEIA&#64258;), with respect to the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 school years.  
  The undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer on September 3, 2008.  At a 
telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) convened on September 25, 2008, the parties 
reported, among other things, that: (1) A resolution meeting had not been successful in 
resolving the dispute; (2) The Board would not challenge the sufficiency of the request for due process; (3) The parties were not currently pursuing a mediated outcome or other 
settlement efforts; and (4) The Board has iden
tified certain evaluation-related issues that it intended to present.  By agreement of th
e parties and the Hearing Officer, the Board&#8482;s 
evaluation-related issues were integrated into this proceeding for resolution
1 and, as directed by the Hearing Officer, the Board identified its eval
uation issues in a submission 
on September 25, 2008 and a clarifying submission on October 27, 2008.   
                                                  1 Integrating the Board&#8482;s issues into this procee
ding would reduce the burdens on the parties of 
pursuing multiple litigations and provide for a more 
comprehensive and expeditious resolution of issues 
regarding the Student.  After discussing with the parties the Hearing Officer&#8482;s concerns regarding 
compliance with the IDEIA&#8482;s procedur
al requirements arising from inte
gration, the Hear
ing Officer was 
satisfied that the parties would work together constructiv
ely to develop procedures to be applied in the case 
to permit both parties to fairly litigate their respective claims.
