Hearing Officer      FINAL DECISION  
 The prehearing conference was held on June 22, 2007 and both parties participated.  The Parent had previously advised either the Board counsel or the Board counsel and the hearing officer that she was consulting two different attorneys to represent her in this 
matter.  The first of these attorneys was a New York attorney who did not respond to a 

fax requesting that he clarify whether he was in fact appearing on the case or not.  During the June 22, 2007 prehearing the Parent indicated that she was consulting a third attorney and requested that the matter be held open until after this consult.  On June 27, 2007 the Board filed a Motion to Dismiss.  On July 
2, 2007 the third attorney that the Parent 
consulted wrote the hearing officer and advised that no decision had been made regarding 
representation, but a discussion with the Parent about the case had occurred.  The Parent did not respond to the Motion to Dismiss and has had no further communication with the 
hearing officer since the June 22, 2007 prehearing.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
  The hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
