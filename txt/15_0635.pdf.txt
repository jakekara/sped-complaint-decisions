FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Is the Board of Education’s transitional evaluation appropriate?
2. If not, is the Student entitled to an independent transitional evaluation at public expense?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Board of Education requested a special education due process hearing in the above—
captioned matter on June 29, 2015 to demonstrate that its evaluation of the Student is
appropriate. The Impaitial Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed to hear the case on June 30, 2015.
A telephonic pre—hearing conference was held on July 20, 2015. Attorney Craig Meuser

At that time, the deadline for ﬁling the ﬁnal decision in this case was established to be August

postponement and extension of the timelines to conduct the hearing and to ﬁle the ﬁnal
decision in this case to September 11, 2015. The purpose of the requested postponement and
extension was to allow time for the paities to palticipate in mediation 7 which was ultimately
scheduled for September 10, 2015 — and to accommodate the hearing dates and thereby allow
for the paities to enjoy due process. The Board of Education consented to the requested
postponement. The deadline was extended to September 11, 2015.

On September 9, 2015 the Board of Education requested a second thiity-day postponement
and extension of the timelines to conduct the hearing and to ﬁle the ﬁnal decision in this case
to October 9, 2015 for the purpose of allowing the parties to enjoy due process. The Student
did not object to the request and it was granted.

Again, the Student did not obj ect t0 the request and it was granted.

On October 16, 2015, the Board of Education requested an additional ten—day postponement
and extension of the timelines to conduct the hearing and to ﬁle the ﬁnal decision in this case
to October 29, 2015 in order to allow the parties time to ﬁnalize a settlement agreement. The
Student did not obj ect to the request and it was granted.

On October 26, 2015 the Board of Education repomed that the parties had ﬁnalized their
settlement agreement and requested that the matter be dismissed with prejudice.
