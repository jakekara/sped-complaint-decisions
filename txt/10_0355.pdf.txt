SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
: The student is 6 years and 3 months old and has been 
previously identified with Developmental Delay and is 
not entitled to receive a free and appropriate public e
ducation (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 
20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. At a PPT meeting the Parent rejected the 
exiting of the Student from special 
education and related services and requested that the Student continue receiving services as
 a student eligible to re
ceive special education and related services. The Board denied the Parent&#8482;s request and the Parent filed for due process.  On or about March 11, 2010 the Board received notice that the Parent requested due process. In lieu of a resolution meeting, mediation was held on June 15, 2010. An impartial hearing officer was appointed on 

March 11, 2010 and a pre-hearing conference was held on April 5, 2010. A hearing date of May 26, 2010 was chosen by the parties. In an electronic transmission the Parent info
rmed the hearing officer that the 
matter was settled and it was bei
ng withdrawn with prejudice.
