  The Parents' attorney requested this h

Board of Education&#8482;s attorney.  The State De
partment of Education ("SDE") received the 
letter on June 25, 2008.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on that date.  On July 11, a prehearing conferen

set at September 8.  Hearing dates were agr

 the August 15 hearing date because the 
Board administrators were not available on that
 date.  On July 16, the Parents&#8482; attorney requested a postponement of the August 20 hearing date because the Parents were not 
available on that date.  Both attorneys re

requested time to discuss a settlement, whic

quested time to reduce it to writing.  An 
additional hearing date was agreed on for September 12 and for an extension of the 
mailing date for the final decision to September 22.  The attorneys were asked to report to 

the Hearing Officer by August 21 whether the case was settled.  On August 21, the 
Parents&#8482; attorney advised the Hearing Officer that the settlement negotiations were 
continuing and that he would update the Heari
