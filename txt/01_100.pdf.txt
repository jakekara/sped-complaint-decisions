and was eligible for special education services with the identification of Specific Learning Disability. (Testimony Mother, B-49, B-60). 
 2.  In the second grade, the Student was initially identified with a specific learning disability due to the 22-point discrepancy between verbal and performance scores.  (Testimony Mother, B-18)  
At that time, in January 1997, no goals and objectives were developed for the Student. 
(Testimony Mother, B-18)  The Student was placed in a &#64257;consult&#64258; period, with no direct 

services.  (Testimony Mother, B-18) 
 3.  The Student continued to be identified as eligible for special education and related services in 
the third grade.  (Testimony Mother, B-25)  Again the student&#8482;s services were listed as &#64257;consult&#64258; 
only, and no goals and objectives were developed for the Student in January 1998.  (Testimony 
Mother, B-25)  The Student&#8482;s Individualized Education Program (hereinafter &#64257;IEP&#64258;) included 
modifications for written assignments, homework assignments and the Connecticut Mastery
