DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
  
 
Fairfield Board of Education v. Student 
 
Appearing on behalf of the Parent:  The Parent appeared pro se.  
Appearing on behalf of the Board:  Attorney Michelle C. Laubin, Berchem, Moses & Devlin, P.C., 75 Broad Street, Milford, CT 06460 
 
Appearing before:  Attorney Elisabeth Borrino, Hearing Officer  
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  
ISSUES: 
 
 1. The Board contended that  the Stude
nt's educational placement should be 
changed to a private placement in 
a residential therapeutic setting.  
 2. The Parent contended that the Boar
d had failed to provide FAPE since the 
Student was placed on home-bound tutoring.  Th
e Board objected to the appropriateness 
of the Parent raising this claim citing a prior Hearing Offi
cer decision whereby the claim 
was raised and dismissed with prejudice.   

 
SUMMARY: 
 
 The Board filed this request for hearing on June 2, 2008.  On June 25, 2008, a 

Prehearing Conference was held.  By way of letter dated July 3, 2008, the Board represented that, at the time of
 the Prehearing Conference,  it was unaware that the Parent had apparently filed a Due Process Claim on May 27, 2008.  The Parent's Due Process 
Claim of May 27, 2008 referenced in the July
 3, 2008 letter by the Board's counsel has 
neither been reviewed by this Hearing Officer nor has any party requested that it be included or consolidated with this Decision. 
 Accordingly, no action is taken thereon.  
 By way of letter dated July 3, 2008, the Board withdrew its due process hearing 

request.   
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
   The matter is 
DISMISSED.
