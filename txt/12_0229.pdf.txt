FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public
education (FAPE) as deﬁned in The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA)
20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement
team (PPT) meeting, the Parent did not approve of the evaluations performed by the Board and
requested an independent psycho-educational evaluation. The Board refused the Parent’s request and
ﬁled for due process.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on December 23, 201 1. On or about January 13, 2012, the
Parent ﬁled for due process alleging that the program offered by the Board for the 2011-2012 school
year was not appropriate. The parent’s attorney ﬁled a Motion to Consolidate the two matters. The
Board did not object to the Motion to Consolidate. On January 27, 2012, the matters were consolidated.
The consolidation altered the timeline of the request for due process.
