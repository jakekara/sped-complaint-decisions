FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1) Did the Board‘s IEP offer FAPE to the student for the 2012-13 school year?

2) If not, are the Parents entitled to be reimbursed for their 2012-13 tuition and
transpoﬁation expenditures for the student's private school?

3) Was the Board's 2012-13 IEP developed in accordance with the IDEA‘s substantive and
procedural requirements?

4) If not, did that result in a denial of FAPE?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY/ SUMMARY:

The Parent ﬁled the Complaint and Request for Due Process Hearing on January 16,
2013. The mailing date of the Final Decision was April 5, 2013. The parties participated in
a telephonic Prehearing Conference on February 8, 2013. The hearing was scheduled for
April 1, 2013.

The hearing convened on April 1, 2013. Before commencing the hearing, the parties
reported to the Hearing Ofﬁcer that they had satisfactorily resolved the issues in dispute but
had not ﬁnalized the terms of the settlement agreement. The patties were not able to ﬁnalize
the terms of a written settlement agreement on the hearing day because of a disagreement
over an outstanding issue. The patties jointly requested an extension of the mailing date and
a second hearing date should the palty be unable to agree on the ﬁnal disputed term. The
palties’ requests were granted pursuant to RCSA Section 10—76-9(e). The mailing date of
the Final Decision was extended to May 3, 2013.

 

May 2, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0293

On April 26, 2013, the patties jointly requested cancellation of the hearing on the
grounds that the parties had a settlement agreement but that the settlement was not fully
executed and that the Parent would withdraw the Request when both palties had signed the
settlement agreement. The Hearing Ofﬁcer denied the request stating that the hearing could
not be cancelled without a withdrawal.

Later in the day, the Parent requested that the hearing be postponed for the same
reasons. The request was denied because it had not been ﬁled ﬁve days before the hearing
in accordance with RCSA 10—76h-9(a). The Parent thereafter ﬁled a request for
reconsideration. The Hearing Ofﬁcer issued a ruling denying both requests on April 29,
2013 pursuant to RCSA Section 10—76h—9(c), After the close of business on April 30, 2013,
the Hearing Ofﬁcer received a notice by electronic mail from the Parent’s attorney that both
panics had signed the agreement and the Parent was withdrawing the Due Process Hearing
Request with prejudice. The notice was not in conformance with notice requirements
contained in the Hearing Ofﬁcer’s Memorandum to Parties

The Hearing convened on May 1, 2013. The Board’s attorney appeared and reported
on behalf of the parties that the Parent had withdrawn the Hearing Request and provided the
Hearing Ofﬁcer with an additional copy of the electronic mail sent by the Parent’s attorney.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED with prejudice
