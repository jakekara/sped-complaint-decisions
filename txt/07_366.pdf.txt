 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
   
PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  This hearing was requested on November 23, 2007, and this hearing officer was appointed on November 26, 2007.  The date for mailing the final decision and order was 
set at February 6, 2008.   
 
A pre-hearing conference was scheduled for January 7, 2008: the Board&#8482;s attorney appeared but the Parents&#8482; attorney did not.  Mediation had been held prior to the request for hearing, without success.  A resolution meeting scheduled for January 4 was 
postponed due to illness.  The hearing was set for January 28, 2008.  
Despite several requests, Parent
s did not reveal specific issues.  However, it was reported that Student was attending Eagle Hill School.  
The Board reported on January 23 that the dispute was resolved at the resolution meeting 
on January 16, and requested on behalf of both parties that the hearing scheduled for January 28 be cancelled, pending execution of an agreement that would include the 
withdrawal of the request for hearing.  On January 24, the hearing officer cancelled the hearing and notified the parties that if she did not receive any further communication 
(such as confirmation of the settlement), th
e matter would be dismissed on February 6, 
2008.
