 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  
 ISSUES:  1. Is the program offered by the 
Board for the 2008-2009 school year 
appropriate and did it provide the 
student with FAPE as defined in 20 USC 1401 et seq? If not; 2. Is the program at Ben Bronz Ac
ademy appropriate and did it provide the Student with FAPE in the LRE? 3. Should the Board be required 
to pay for an IEE of the Student? 4. Should the Board be required to
 pay for an independent achievement 
evaluation of the Student&#8482;s Goals and Objectives? 5.  Did the Board commit a procedural 
violation by impeding the Parents&#8482; meaningful participation in the PPT process which caused a denial of 
FAPE?  SUMMARY:  The Student is a 17 year 9 months old young man who has b
een identified as a student requiring special education and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education as defined in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a.. The Parents were assisted by a parent advocate during the first 2 days of this hearing.  The Student&#8482;s Parents rejected the Board&#8482;s IEP for the 2008-2009 school year.  Th
e Parents were seeking that the Student 
remain in his current out of district pl
acement, Ben Bronz Academy, and requested an 
Independent Educational Evaluation.  The Board rejected the Parents&#8482; request and 
proceeded with a due process.
