FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. What is the Student’s stay—put?
2. Does the Student’s stay-put include a shadow nurse?
3, Is the existing safety plan provided to the Student appropriate?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) as
deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq.
and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the
Parents objected to the safety plan provided for the Student and requested that a shadow nurse be
provided. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On October 28, 2013, the Board received notice of the Pai'ents’ request for due process. The parties
agreed to the resolution meeting. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on October 29, 2013 and a
pre—hearing conference was held on November 7, 2013 and November 11, 2013. A hearing date of
November 20, 2013 was chosen by the parties.

In an electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney requested that the hearing ofﬁcer cancel the
November 20, 2013 hearing date because their witness would not be available. The hearing date was
canceled. On November 25, 2013 the Parents’ attorney asked that they be allowed to withdraw the
request for due process without prejudice. The Board did not object to the request. The request was
granted. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is January 1 1, 2014.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is dismissed without prejudice.

if the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁﬂeen days aﬁer
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
