receive FAPE in the LRE?

5. Should the Board reimburse the Parents for the cost of applied behavioral analytic (ABA) services, parent

6. Is the Student entitled to Compensatory Education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals With
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At
a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the
2015-2016 school year. The Parents requested a two day placement at Meliora Academy and three days of
homebound instruction provided by Meliora Academy for the 2015-2016 school year. The Board refused the
Parents’ request. On December 7, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. An
impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on December 7, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was held on
December 22, 2015. The parties agreed to go to mediation meeting on January 7, 2016. In an electronic
transmission dated February 18, 2016, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties were able
to resolve the issues and requested that the matter be withdrawn with prejudice. There was no objection by the
Board. The withdrawal was granted. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is March 21, 2016.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
