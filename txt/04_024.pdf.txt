Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   The prehearing conference in this matter was held on February 4, 2004 and the date for 
mailing of the final decision was originally March 15, 2004.  By agreement of the parties 
an initial hearing date was set for March 2, 2004.  At hearing the parties requested time to 
try to resolve the matter through mediation.  This was granted and a new date was set for 
April 12, 2004.  The Board filed a Motion to Dismiss which, due to the short timeline for 
response by the Parent, was not acted upon by the Hearing Officer.  At hearing on April 12, 2004 the Board informed the Hearing Officer that the Parent had withdrawn the 
matter without prejudice fewer than five business days earlier. 
   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
