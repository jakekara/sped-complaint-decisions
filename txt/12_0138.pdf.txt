FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:
1. Whether the Board’s proposed program for the Student is appropriate;

2. If not, whether the Board shall fund the Student’s placement at a residential treatment
school for up to 12 months.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:

This request for hearing was submitted by the Parents’ attorney on October 6, 201 l. The
prehearing conference was initially scheduled for October 19, 2011 and was rescheduled for
October 25, 201 l at the request of counsel.

At the ﬁrst preheating conference on October 25, 2011 the Board’s attorney was present, but the
Parents’ attorney was not present. The Board’s attorney noted that she had a signed agreement
in the matter, and agreed to the scheduling of a second prehearing conference to allow the
Parents’ attorney time to submit notiﬁcation to the hearing ofﬁcer of the settlement or to proceed
with a second preheating conference at the end of the week. On October 25, 2011 the Parents’
attorney submitted notiﬁcation that he was in a meeting and forgot about the prehearing
conference. He noted in that email that once he knows that the Board signed the agreement, he
will withdraw his request for hearing. Subsequently, on the same date, the Parents’ attorney
submitted an email that the agreement was signed by all parties and that he withdraws his request
with prejudice. Therefore, this matter is dismissed.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED.
