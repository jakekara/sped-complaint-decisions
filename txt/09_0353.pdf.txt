 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  ISSUE:  
Whether the Board&#8482;s refusal to fund an independ
ent evaluation requested by the Parents shall be sustained? 

 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  This hearing was requested by the Board on March 10, 2009, and the Hearing Officer was appointed 
on March 13, 2009.  Because the Board had also requ
ested an Advisory Opinion, the pre-hearing 
conference was deferred until after that proceeding.  Meanwhile, another Planning and Placement 
Team meeting was held on March 31, 2009, at which 
time the programmatic issu
es in dispute were resolved through modifications in the Student&#8482;s Indi
vidualized Education Program (IEP).  The Board 
did not consider the matter settled because the Parent
s had not specifically writ
ten their withdrawal of 
a request for an independent evaluation. 
 
When the Hearing Officer notified the Parties that
 a pre-hearing conference 
would be held on May 8, 2009 the Board&#8482;s Attorney responded by FAX on May 
8, approximately ten minutes prior to the 
scheduled pre-hearing conference, that the dispute had been resolved and enclosed a copy of relevant 
portions of the March 31, 2009, IEP and a short letter from the Parents, dated 
May 4, 2009, stating that they were satisfied with the revised IEP and ha
d been advised of their rights.  The Board was 
unwilling to withdraw its request for a hearing until 
it received a written statement from the Parents 
withdrawing their request for an independent evaluation.  The Board&#8482;s Attorney also stated that she could not be available for the pre-hearing conferen
ce on that date, and asked that it be postponed to May 11, 2009.
