FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The student is not identiﬁed as a student entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”) as
deﬁned in IDEA 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a. The Parent requested that
the Student be identiﬁed as entitled to receive FAPE; the Board refused the Parent’s request. The Board
received notice of the request for due process on February 19, 2011. The parties agreed to mediate the matter.
An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on February 23, 2011 and a pre—hearing conference was held on

March 4,2011.

On March 29, 2011, the parties were sent an electronic transmission asking if a mediation date had been set: the
parties did not respond. On April 22, 2011, the parties were sent an electronic transmission requesting a status
repOIt. On April 25, 2011, the Board’s attorney responded that the matter had been resolved; no response was
received from the Parent’s attorney. Since the Parent’s attorney did not respond, on April 26, 2011 the parties
were sent notice of a May 2, 2011 hearing date. The parties neither responded nor objected. At the due process
hearing, neither the Parent nor either party’s attorney appeared. The Board called their attorney who informed
me that the Parent’s attorney had spoken with her and was to inform the hearing ofﬁcer about the status of the
matter. No notice was received from the Parent’s attorney. At the due process hearing the matter was dismissed
for lack of due diligence. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is May 5, 2011.

.FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED FOR LACK OF DUE DILIGENCE.
