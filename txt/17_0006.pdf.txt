FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

for the 2016-2017 school year?

the Parents’ attorney informed the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties had signed an agreement and
withdrew the matters with prejudice. The date for the mailing the F inal Decision and Order is
Septembe1'21, 2016.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.
