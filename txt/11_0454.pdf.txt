FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Whether the transportation provided in the Student’s program for the 2010—1 1 and 201 1-
12 school years is appropriate;

2. If not whether the Board shall provide the transportation for the Student as requested by
the Parent.

SUMMARY :

The Student is eligible for special education and has been offered van transponation in
her IEP for the 2010-1 1 and 2011-12 school years. The Father, who has joint legal and physical
custody of the Student, ﬁled this request for hearing, seeking to alter the schedule of the van
transportation to accommodate his schedule.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Board received this request for hearing [Exhibit H.O.-1] ﬁled by the Father on May 6, 201 1
and preheating conferences were convened on June 7, June 9 and June 13, 2011. At the ﬁrst
two prehearing conferences, the Father was not available. The third prehearing conference was
convened as a courtesy to attempt to secure the Father’s attendance, and the Father and the
Board’s representative both palticipated in the third prehearing conference.

June 29, 2011 Case No. 11-0454

The hearing convened on one hearing date 011 June 28, 2011. The Father was the only witness
testifying on behalf of the Student. The Board’s witness was Typhanie Jackson, Board director
of student services.

The Father did not submit any exhibits, nor did he submit a witness list. The Board submitted
exhibits number B-l through B-17, which are entered as full exhibits.

After the Father presented his case in chief on June 28, 201 1, the Board’s attorney requested that
the case be dismissed. That request was taken under advisement, and the Board’s attorney was
directed to present evidence on the Board’s offer of transportation to the Student. The Board
director of student services provided such testimony. The granting of the dismissal is not
necessary, as based on the testimony presented and exhibits submitted, the Board has prevailed
on the merits oi‘the case.

To the extent that the procedural history, summaiy and ﬁndings of fact actually represent
conclusions of law, they should be so considered, and vice versa. Bonnie Ann F . V. Caliallen

Independent School Board, 835 F. Supp. 340 (SD. Tex. 1993)
STATEMENT OF JURIDISCTION:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes
(“CGS”) §10-76h and related regulations, 20 United States Code §1415(f) and related
regulations, and in accordance with the Uniform Administration Procedures Act (“UAPA”),

schedule for custody is decided by the Parents and is not pursuant to a count order. This
schedule could be changed at any time by the Parents. [Testimony Father]

2010 to March 2011 included van transportation for the Student to the Mother’s home.

transpoﬁation for the Student to the Mother’s home. [Testimony Father, Exhibit B-12]

June 29, 201] Case No. 11—0454

6. The Board has offered van transportation to the Student to the Mother’s address, and has
consistently provided the van transportation in accordance with the IEP. [Testimony
F ather]

7‘ The Student was not denied a free appropriate public education [FAPE] due to the alleged
lack of transportation and the Student had excellent attendance during the 2010-11 school
year. [Testimony Father, Exhibit B-i7]

8. At the time the Father was challenging the proposed transponation schedule, the Mother
disagreed with the Father’s proposal of changing the drop off or pick up location to the
Father’s residence. [Testimony Father]

DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:

The Father brought this action in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act [IDEA] which provides for special education and related services to children with
disabilities, from bilth through age 21. It is undisputed that the Student is entitled to receive a
free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”) with special education and related services
under the disability category of autism pursuant to state and federal laws. E Conn, Gen. Stat.
§§ 10-76 at seq.; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.Ci § 1401, et
seq.

The standard for determining whether a FAPE has been provided is set fmth in Board of
Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowlev, 458 US. 176 (1982). The
two-pronged inquiry set fonh in Rowley asks ﬁrst whether the procedural requirements of IDEA
have been reasonably met and, second, whether the IEP is “reasonably calculated to enable the
child to receive educational benefits.” I_d. at 206—207

Nothing in the record supports the conclusion that there were any procedural Violations
which resulted in a denial ofFAPE to the Student.

The second prong 0f Rowley is the determination of whether the Board offered the

Student an appropriate IEP. The proper gauge for determining the IEP is substantively

June 29, 201 1 Case No, 11—0454

appropriate is the question of “whether the educational program provided for a child is
reasonably calculated to allow the child to receive ‘meaningful’ educational benefits.” Mrs. B. V.
Milford Board of Education, 103 F.3d 11 14, 1120 (2nd Cir. 1997). Meaningful educational
beneﬁts are “not everything that might be thought desirable by loving parents." Tucker v. Bay
Shore Union Free School Dist, 873 F.2d 503, 567 (2nd Cir. 1989). The Father testiﬁed that he
agreed that the Student had been provided FAPE during the 2010-1 1 school year. As the
transpottation continues to be door to door transportation for the Student through the IEP for the
201 1-12 school year, the Student’s transportation component of her IEP is appropriate. The
Board’s IEP for 2010—1 1 school year and the IEP for 201 1—12 school year provide door to door
van transpoﬁation as a related sewice for the Student.

The Board has met its burden of proof, demonstrating by a preponderance of evidence
that the IEP for the 2010—1 1 and the 2011—12 school year offers the Student a FAPE in the
transpmtation that is being provided and offered to the Student.

Because the transportation provided in the IEPS for the 2010~1 1 and 201 1—12 school

years is appropriate, the Father is not entitled to his requested alternative tl'ansponation.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

1. The transportation provided in the Student’s program for the 2010-11 and 201 1-12 school
years is appropriate.

2. The Board is not required to provide an alternative transportation schedule for the
Student as requested by the Father.
