The prehearing conference was convened on August 28, 2001 at which time the hearing was scheduled for September 10 and 11, 2001. On September 5, 2001 the Assistant Attorney General representing the Department of Children and Families requested a continuance. The attorney for the student supported the request stating that the parties were engaged in settlement discussions. A continuance was granted and a hearing date of October 3, 2001 was set. On September 25, 2001, the hearing officer sent a facsimile message to the parties asking whether they intended to proceed with the hearing. On September 26, 2001, the attorney for the student responded in a facsimile message, stating that the parties continued to work toward settlement, which they believed was a better use of time than convening the hearing. He also stated in his message that he understood that the matter would be dismissed without prejudice if the parties did not proceed. The hearing officer responded in a facsimile message dated September 27, 2001, stating that, based upon the representations of the student&#8482;s attorney, the hearing date of October 3, 2001 would be canceled and the hearing dismissed without prejudice.
