June 24, 2011 Final Decision and Order 11-0347

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been previously identiﬁed as entitled to receive a free and appropriate
public education (“FAPE”) as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Improvement Act (IDEIA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10—
76a. At a PPT, the Parent objected to the program offered by the Board for the 2010-20] 1
school year and requested an interim homebound program with tutoring and related
services from 9:00 am. to 3:30 pm. until the Board is able to provide an appropriate and
safe program for the Student. The Board refused the Parent’s request.

On or about March 1 1, 201 1, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request for due
process. The parties agreed to waive the resolution meeting and to mediate the matter. A
May 20, 201 1 mediation date was provided to the parties.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on March 14, 201 1 and a pre—hearing
conference was held on March 21, 2011. A hearing date of May 26, 201 1 was chosen by
the parties. The May 26, 2011 hearing date was cancelled to allow the parties time to
mediate the matter; hearing dates of June 21 and 22, 2011 were chosen.

At the ﬁrst day of hearing the parties informed the hearing ofﬁcer that an agreement had
just been signed. The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order is June 24,

2011.
