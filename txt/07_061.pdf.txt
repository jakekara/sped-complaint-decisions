sent via facsimile to both parties for a 
prehearing on March 16.  No notice was received from the Parent indicating that she was 
unavailable for the scheduled prehearing conference, nor requesting contact at an 
alternative telephone number for the prehearing conference.  On March 16, the Board was available for the prehearing, but the Parent was not available at the telephone number provided in her request for hearing. 
 As a courtesy to the Parent, a second prehearing conference was scheduled for March 20.  Notice was sent to both parties via facsimile of this second prehearing 
conference, with directions to
 confer with the other party if the date or time was not 
convenient, and to provide another contact number if avai

at the time of the scheduled 
prehearing.  No notice was received from the Parent in 
response to the Notice of Second Prehearing 
Conference.   At the second prehearing conference, the Board was available, but the Parent was not available at the telephone number provided in her request for hearing.
