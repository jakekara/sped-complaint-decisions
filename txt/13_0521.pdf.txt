PRO CEDURAL HISTORY:

The Parents ﬁled the request for a due process hearing on June 13, 2013. The Parties
agreed to waive the resolution meeting in favor of mediation. The original due process
hearing was scheduled for July 25, 2013. The original ﬁnal decision and order date was
set for August 27, 2013. Mediation was subsequently scheduled for July 25, 2013, which
necessitated the change of hearing date. Due to a change in mediators, the mediation date
was changed to August 2, 2013. The new hearing date was set for August 15, 2013; the
ﬁnal decision and order (late was continued to August 27, 2013. At the end of July, a
change in the hearing date was requested by one of the counsel due to a personal matter.
The earliest date that could be scheduled was August 15, 2013. Mediation was
subsequently held on August 2, 2013, in which the Parties reached a tentative settlement
which needed to be drafted and signed by the Parties. Due to the school personnel being
on vacation for the next two weeks and a personal emergency for one of the counsel, the
hearing date was re-scheduled to September 12, 2013, and the mailing date for the ﬁnal
decision and order was extended to September 26, 2013. On September 5, 2013, Counsel
for the Board requested an extension of the ﬁnal decision and order date to allow him
time to draft the agreement and work out any language problems that may occur before
signing. On September 26, 2013 the Parties requested one ﬁnal extension to October 7 to
get all of the Palties together to sign the agreement. The ﬁnal decision and order date
was moved to October 7, 2013, based on the word of counsel that the Student had been
receiving the new program and sewices and would continue to do so and as such was not
going to suffer any negative impact from the extension. On October 4, 2013, Counsel for
the Parents indicated in writing that the agreement had been signed by all Parties and that
the Parents wished to withdraw their request for a due process hearing, with prejudice.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

On October 4, 2013 the Parents stated in writing that they had reached settlement with the
Board and wished to withdraw their due process complaint, with prejudice. With no
further issues to be decided in this matter, the hearing is DISMISSED with prejudice.
