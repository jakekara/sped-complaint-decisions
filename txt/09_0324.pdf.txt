 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 ISSUE:  1. Is the Board required to fund the independent educational, psychiatric, psycho-       neurological, occupational therapy and physical therapy evaluations requested by the         Parent at the February 13, 2009 Planning and Placement Team meeting? 
  PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
    The Board&#8482;s Supervisor of Special Educati
on requested this hearing on February 13, 2009 by faxing a form to the State Department of
 Education and mailing a copy to the Surrogate 
Parent.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on February 25, 2009.  The Board&#8482;s attorney filed an appearance on March 2, 2009.  The Parent&#8482;s atto
rney filed an appearance on March 12, 2009.  A prehearing conference was held with the Board&#8482;s attorney on March 23, 2009.  The Parent&#8482;s attorney did not answer her te
lephone.  The mailing date of the final decision 
was established as March 30, 2009.  The Board&#8482;s attorney reported that a resolution meeting was scheduled later that day and that, if the case was not resolved, 
she would contact the Parent&#8482;s attorney and the Hearing Officer to schedule a second prehearing conference.  On March 24, 2009, the Board&#8482;s attorney advised the Hearing Officer that the Parent did not disagree with the Board&#8482;s evaluations and that the Board was withdrawing its request for a hearing.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
:  It is ordered that this 
case shall be dismissed.
