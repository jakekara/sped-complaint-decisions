PRO CEDURAL HISTORY

This matter is before the Hearing Ofﬁcer pursuant to the Request for Due Process ﬁled by the Parent and
received by the Board on September 30, 2010.

The issues addressed during the Due Process Hearing were raised at Planning and Placement Team (“PPT”)
meetings on June 12, 2008, December 18, 2008 and June 17, 2009, with the exception of the placement of the
Student at the Solomon Schecter Academy at the Board’s expense.

By way of this request for Due Process Hearing, the Parent requested that the Hearing Ofﬁcer order that the
Board pay for the Student’s placement at Solomon Schecter Academy (“SSA”), provide and pay for special
education services by private providers, reimburse the Parent for the cost of the related expenses, reimburse the
Parent for the cost of evaluations, consultations, and attendance at PPTs by Dr. Kemper and Geraldine
Theodore, and provide compensatory education services. The Parent also requested that the Hearing Ofﬁcer
ﬁnd that the Board committed multiple procedural Violations.

The Board ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss the Parents’ Due Process Hearing Request. That Motion was denied.

Hearings convened on December 1, 15, and 17, 2010. The Hearing Ofﬁcer directed the palties to submit their
respective post hearing briefs by December 27, 2010.

The date for mailing the ﬁnal decision was December 14, 2010. However, upon joint motion of the parties, in
order to be able to presentnecessa1y multiple witnesses and evidence, and aﬁer careful consideration of the

following factors:

(1) the extent of danger to the child’s educational interest or well being which might be occasioned by
the delay;

(2) the need of either party for additional time to prepare and present their position at the hearing in
accordance with the requirements of the process;

(3) any ﬁnancial or other detrimental consequence likely to be suffered by a party in the event of the
delay;

(4) whether there has already been a delay in the proceeding through the actions of the parties.

the date was extended to January 13, 2010.

January 10, 2011 3 Final Decision and Order 11-0143

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes (“CGS”) §10-76h and
related regulations, 20 United States Code §1415(f) and related regulations, and in accordance with the
Uniform Administration Procedures Act (“UAPA”), CGS §§ 4—176e to 4-178, inclusive, §§4—181a and 4—186.

SUMMARY

The Student is currently eleven years old. He began receiving early intensive intewention through the Birth to
Three program, and was diagnosed with Autism when he was two years, seven months old. The Student
entered the East Lyme Public Schools (“the Board”) when he was three years old. During the 2005—2006
school year, the Student was placed in a regular education kindergarten classroom with a one to one aide. in
December 2006, the Student was placed at the Hope Academy, a private special education school where he
remained until June 2008.

During Spring of 2008, the Parent began exploring SSA for placement. In August 2008, the Parent advised the
Board that she intended to enroll the Student at SSA for 2008—2009 by way of a verbal discussion. Because the
Parent was hesitant to lose the placement at Hope if SSA was not satisfactory, the Board agreed to maintain the
availability of the Student’s placement at Hope for the 2008-2009 school year.

On September 2, 2008, the Student began attending SSA at the Parent’s expense and remained in that
placement through the date of Hearing.

During a PPT on December 18, 2008, the parties agreed that the Student would remain placed at SSA at the
Parent’s expense but the Board would provide certain additional related services.

Thereaﬁer, at subsequent PPTs, the Board declined to continue to pay for the additional related services.

On June 17, 2009, a PPT convened and recommended that the Board provide an appropriate program at the
Niantic Center School or the home school, Flanders Elementaly School, if the Parent so desired, as well as

ESY.

The Parent rejected this recommendation and maintained the unilateral placement at SSA. The Board
disagreed with this placement.

This Final Decision and Order sets forth the Hearing Ofﬁcer’s ﬁndings of fact and conclusions of law. To the
extent that ﬁndings of fact actually represent conclusions of law, they should be so considered, and Vice versa.
For reference, see SAS Institute, Inc., v. S & H Compuler Systems, Inc., 605 F. Supp. 816, (March 6, 1985); and
Bonnie Arm F. v. Callallen Independent School District, 835 F. Supp. 340 (SD. Tex. 1993).

Any motions not previously ruled upon are hereby denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1‘ The Student is cun‘ently eleven years old and eligible for special education and related services under
the category of Autism, (Testimony Parent, 12/ 1/ 10; Exh. B-35)

The Student attended the East Lyme Public Schools (“the Board”) during kindergarten and ﬁrst grade
and had an IEP in place. During ﬁrst grade, he was assigned a dedicated one to one aide in unstructured
school settings. He was transpOIted to and from school on a special needs van. (Exh. P—8)

During the 2007—2008 school year, the Student attended second grade at Hope Academy (“Hope”), an
approved special education facility pursuant to an Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) provided
by the Board. (Testimony Parent, 12/1/10)

On December 17, 2007, a PPT was convened wherein it was recommended that the Student continue at
Hope at the Board’s expense. Pursuant to the recommendations of an Occupational Therapy (“OT”)
evaluation, the Student would receive 30 minutes per week of OT services at Hope. The Board would
provide transpoﬁation. No other options were considered or rejected. The Parent was noted to be
“pleased with [the Student’s] progress.” (Exh. B—l)

The Student made progress on his eleven IEP goals and objectives, including satisfactmy progress in
nine goals, and masteiy of two. The Student also made appropriate progress in his speech and language
as well as OT. He is noted by the Speech and Language Pathologist to have made “signiﬁcant gains in
expressive and receptive language skills, articulation and pragmatic language.” (Exhs. B—2, B-3, B—4,
B—S, B-6, B—9)

During Spring 012008, the Parent contacted Solomon Schecter Academy (“SSA”) regarding enrolling
the Student at SSA. (Parent Testimony12/ 1/ 10)

On June 12, 2008, a Flaming and Placement Team (“PPT”) was convened for the Student’s annual
review. Therein it was determined that he would continue to attend Hope during 2008—2009 for third
grade. This was based upon review of the Student’s academic progress, teacher and sewices provider
observations, and input from the Parent. (Exh. B—8)

Pursuant to the June 12, 2008 IEP, the Student would receive 22.0 hours of OT during the school year
to be provided within the school setting on a weekly basis to the maximum extent possible. The
Student would also receive 1.0 hours per week of speech and language. (Exh. B-8)

Pursuant to the June 12, 2008 IEP, the Student would receive ESY 0f 5 — one hour speech and language
sessions, and two weeks of the summer session by Hope with transportation provided by the Board.
The Parent requested a ﬁve week summer session at Hope, instead. This was rejected by the PPT
ﬁnding that the program offered by the district was appropriate. The Parent elected the two week
program at Hope in lieu of the ﬁve week district program. (Exh. B-8)

During the June 12, 2008 PPT, the Parent expressed concerns about the Student’s reading and requested
a reading evaluation at that time. The Board denied this request in that Hope assessed the Student to be
reading at or above grade level, the speech and language pathologist at Hope determined that the
Student was making signiﬁcant progress in expressive language, and that he was using lengthier and
syntactically more complex sentences with the use of conjunctions and embedded clauses “with only
occasional misuse of ilTegular verb tenses.” Grammar had improved dramatically, (Exhs. P—8, P—59,
B-6)

On August 18, 2008, the Parent spoke with Stephen Buck regarding her concerns at Hope, which

included the Student’s social development, lack of interaction with typical peers, and that the Student
had reportedly been hit and harassed by another student at Hope. Mr. Buck represented that he would
place the Student on a leave of absence from Hope. The Parent would then enroll the Student at
Solomon Schechter Academy (SSA) on a trial basis in September, 2008. Mr. Buck informed the Parent
that he had a contractual obligation to pay Hope pursuant to the June 12, 2008 IEP. However, he did
not have a contract with the livery service transportation and would cancel that. (Testimony Parent
12/1/10, 12/17/10; Exhs. P-23, P-59, P-96)

The Parent enrolled the Student at SSA for the 2008-2009 school year. The Parent did not provide prior
written notice to the Board that she was enrolling the Student at SSA; nor did she inform the Board she
expected such placement to be at public expense prior thereto. When the Parent so em‘olled the Student
at SSA, this constituted parental placement in a private, religious school. (Parent Testimony, 12/ 1/ 10)

On October 2, 2008, Robert L. Kemper, Ph.D., a clinical psycho linguist, evaluated the Student at the
request of the Parent. He diagnosed the Student with dyslexia and speciﬁc language impairment. This
included expressive language difficulties that were primarily the result of difﬁculties with underlying
syntactic deﬁcits. The Parent did not provide prior notice to or consult with the Board prior to
contracting with Dr. Kemper to perform this evaluation. (Testimony Parent, 12/1/10)

On December 12, 2008, the Parent received Dr. Robelt Kemper‘s evaluation report. Dr. Kemper
claimed that the Student would beneﬁt from a low teacher-student ratio and enrollment in a language
immersion program. Dr. Kemper concluded that the Student had an expressive language disorder, little
or no ability to decode despite having a well-developed sight word vocabulary, would eventually “hit a
brick wall” in reading because decoding is essential to effective reading, and that he had a Speciﬁc
Language Impairment, an expressive language disorder, with syntax as the kernel of that disorder.
Moreover, that the Student had to be explicitly taught innate grammatical structures. If not remediated
properly, Dr. Kemper opined that the Student could not express himself effectively across contexts. The
Parent provided a copy of this rep01t to Mr. Buck. (Testimony Parent 12/1/10; Testimony Dr. Kemper;
Bxhs. P—26, P—35, P—81)

A substantial separate language emersion program is deﬁned by Dr. Kemper as one where the goal or
purpose of the program is language. The program is driven by language skills and strategies, as
opposed to content, which would be the basis for a program that would be a more typical type of
education program. Most include instruction for dyslexia. (Testimony Dr. Kemper)

After Dr. Kemper’s evaluation, the Parent explored language immersion schools in four different states.
The Parent was unable to ﬁnd an appropriate language immersion school that was willing to accept the
Student. (Testimony Patent 12/ 1/ 10)

On December 18, 2008, the PPT recommended that, although the Parent was responsible for tuition and
transportation costs if she intended to keep the Student at SSA, the Board would voluntarily pay for
software and related services for the remainder of 2008-2009, including ﬁve hours per week of Orton—
Gillingham tutoring, 2.5 hours per week of speech and language, and 1.5 hours per week of combined
OT and PT. The Board also agreed to provide an adaptive technology evaluation, to be reviewed in the
Spring along with the results of other evaluations that the Parent stated she was planning to obtain. The
Parent accepted these recommendations and did not request that the Board pay for the SSA tuition or
any other costs. (Testimony Parent 12/1/10; Exhs. B—lS, B—16)

The December 18, 2008 IEP notes that the Student “has made a smooth transition into Solomon
Schechter. He is aware of social cues in the classroom and is participating in all academic areas.” (Exh.
B-lS)

The December 18, 2008 PPT reviewed teacher i'epoxts as well as Dr. Kemper’s Psycholinguistic
Evaluation of October 2, 2008. Although Dr. Kemper recommended 4.25 hours of speech and language
therapy per week in addition to the Student being in a language immersion school, the December 28,
2008 IEP provides that he was to receive 2.5 hours per week at SSA. The Board was providing such
services to facilitate a transition to SSA. (Testimony Mr. Reas; Exhs. B—15, P-26)

By way of letter dated December 21, 2008, the Parent confirmed the agreement that the Board would
provide an assistive technology evaluation, 5 hours per week of Orton— Gillingham instruction, and 2.5
hours per week of speech and language therapy to be given by a speech and language pathologist to
remediate the Student’s expressive language and articulation disorder. The letter also conﬁrmed the
agreement that the Parent would be responsible for the SSA tuition, transportation, extended day
programing at SSA, a math aide at SSA, Dr. Kemper’s evaluation, Dr. Kemper’s participation in the
PPT, and a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. Synthia Brooks. (Exh. B-16)

On Januaiy 23, 2009, L&M Hospital administered the CELF~3 t0 the Student without either prior
consent of or notice to the Parent. (Exhs. B-lS, B-18, P-32)

On Februaly 10, 2009, the Parent and the Board agreed to amend the December 18, 2008 LEP to provide
for an additional .5 hours of speech and language per week beginning in the middle of February in that
the bulk of the speech and language therapy began after the other related services. In the sewice
delivery grid of the amended IEP, the start date of all the related services was changed from veiy early
September 2008 to the middle of December 2008 or to February 1 1, 2009. (Testimony Parent 12/1/10;
Exhs B-lS, B—23)

On February 15, 2009, the Student’s 2008—2009 IEP was revised to further increase the speech and
language sewices to 3.0 hours per week. This was by agreement between the Parent and the Board.
(Testimony Parent 12/1/10; Exhs B—15, B-23)

1n the Spring of 2009, at Dr. Kemper's suggestion, the Parent visited the Kildonan School, a private
special education facility with a program that emphasizes Orton-Gillingham instruction. The Student
was accepted to this program, but the Parent chose not to enroll him there. (Testimony Parent 12/1/10,
Testimony Dr. Kemper)

On May 15, 2009, Dr. Kemper performed a Modiﬁed Psycho linguist Evaluation on the Student. Dr.
Kempei‘ reported that the Student had made veiy signiﬁcant gains with his dyslexia owing to 5.0 hours
per week of individual Orton-Gillingham instruction. However, the Student’s atypical speech was still
discernible to most unskilled listeners. Written expression had regressed with a spontaneous writing
quotient at the 5th percentile. Dr. Kemper changed his prior recommendation from a language
immersion school to a “small, structured education program, and a two hour individual daily tutorial in
oral and written expression” taught by a well-trained, experienced speech and language pathologist. Dr.
Kemper ﬁnther opined that the Student has “an extremely complex language— based learning disability.”
He recommended a signiﬁcant reduction in the Student’s weekly Orton—Gillingham instmction and

supported the recommendations of the assistive technology evaluation. Dr. Kemper also recommended
ESY of 4.5 hours per week of speech and language and 1.5 hours of individual Orton Gillingham
tutoring from a certiﬁed Orton-Gillingham tut01‘“to prevent loss and/or further loss of expressive
language skills.” (Testimony Dr. Kemper; Exhs. P-21, P-35, P—47)

Dr. Kemper deﬁnes a small structured education program as one where the activities are predictable and
structured throughout the day. (Testimony Dr. Kemper)

When Dr. Kemper reevaluated the Student, at the request of the Parent, to update his prior report, he no
longer recommended the separate language emersion program. One of these reasons was that the
Student was not accepted to the program Dr. Kemper recommended, (Testimony Parent 12/1/10,
Testimony Dr. Kemper; Exh. P—35)

Ms. Geraldine Theodore, MS, CCC—SLP is an associate professor of communications, and a supervisor
of graduate student clinicians in speech- language pathology who specializes in the treatment of
complex language disorders. (Exh. P—63)

In June 2009, Ms. Theodore began providing services to the Student. This included using “Framing
Your Thoughts” in a very methodical, systematized way to teach the Student syntax. (Exhs. P—63, P~64,
P—73)

On June 8, 2009, and again on June 15, 2009, the Parent met with Dr. Berglund to discuss 2009 ESY
services as the Parent believed that the Student had regressed in written expression. (Parent Testimony
12/1/10; Exh. P—40)

During the June 8, 2009 meeting, the Parent presented Dr. Bergland with a contract for 2009 ESY
language services of 4.5 hours per week with Ms. Theodore and a contract for the month of J une 2009.
The Board agreed to pay for the June 2009 services. (Exhs. P-3 l , P-38, P—39, P-47, P—61)

On June 17, 2009, the Board convened a PPT for the Student’s annual review at SSA. Dr. Berglund
administered the PPT. The PPT team considered the Student’s progress at SSA, reports from the
Parent, teachers and sewice providers, and evaluations in the areas of speech and language pathology,
adaptive technology and psycholinguistics. (Exhs. B—18, B-19, B—28, B-30 through B-35)

During the June 17, 2009 PPT, Dr. Kelnper participated Via teleconference. Therein he opined that the
Student required a highly structured, highly monitored school setting, two hours per day or ten hours
per week of instructional language from a highly qualiﬁed speech and language pathologist, and three
hours per week of Olton-Gillingham instruction. He speculated that if the Student were in a typical
school setting, he would derive no beneﬁt from his related services. He further opined that the
Student’s disability requires that he receive language instruction individually and that once celtain skills
and strategies are established that he move into a small structured group of two or three students so that
he can practice on the generalization and reinforcement of those skills. (Testimony Dr. Kemper; Exh.
P-47)

Dr. Kemper opined that the J une 17, 2009 EP has several goals and objectives that are not consistent
with the Student’s current level of functioning, lack speciﬁcity in terms of discussing 0r identifying the
problem areas and are too general. Further, that some areas were completely polar opposite, 01~ atypical

of what the Student needed. Dr. Kempcr did not support the Board’s speech and language
recommendations. (Testimony Dr. Kemper; Exhs. P—31, P—32, P-35)

The June 17, 2009 PPT recommended that if the Parent continued the Student’s unilateral placement at
SSA, that the Board would not be responsible for the 2009—2010 program. Further, the PPT proposed a
program wherein the student would have a case manager with weekly team meetings; code emphasis
reading instruction that incorporates Orton—Gillingham principles 50 minutes per day provided by a
Special Education Teacher delivered 1:1 and in small group; 2.5 hours of speech and language therapy
per week delivered 1:] and small group, one hour of OT per week (.5 direct and consult), Physical
therapy consult and adaptive PE of 20 minutes per week delivered 1:1 and small group,
Keyboarding/computer of 50 minutes per week delivered in the regular classroom, Social/behavioral of
one hour per week by a psychologist delivered in small group, and transportation as appropriate. The
proposed program was noted to be best implemented at Niantic Center School but would be provided at
the home school — F landers Elementary - if the Parent desired. Niantic Center School provides a small
environment and, according to Dix Berglund, probably one of the most excellent Special Education
Teachers.(Exhs. B-35, P-47)

The Parent rejected the program recommended at the June 17, 2009 PPT. (Testimony Parent)
The June 17, 2009 IEP offered FAPE to the Student. (Exh. 13—35)

The June 17, 2009 IEP offered ESY to be provided by Haynes School July 7, 2009 through July 30,
2009 of up to 36 hours; and/or August 3, 2009 through August 14, 2009 which included up to 30 hours,
code emphasis reading and writing, expressive and social pragmatic language based on IEP goals, and
transpoﬁation provided as needed. The June 17, 2009 IEP thereby offered FAPE to the Student for
ESY 2009. (Exhs. B-35, P—47)

During the June 17, 2009 PPT, the Parent requested special education and related services while the
Student attended SSA. The Board refused and explained to the parent that this was on the basis that it
had no responsibility for the provision of services as the Student was in a unilateral placement in a
private school outside the district. No other options were considered or rejected. (Bxhs. B~35, P—47)

During the June 17, 2009 PPT, the Parent requested information on out of district placements other than
SSA. Dr. Berglund offered to show the Parent what could be provided by the Board. She informed the
parent that her best suggestion would be Niantic Center School because it is a small environment and
has probably one of the most excellent special education teachers. Dr. Berglund also discussed Hope
and the “LEARN program.” Dr. Berglund referred the Parent to the superintendent for additional
information. (Exh. P—47)

On June 26, 2009, the Parent met with the Special Education Director and the Assistant Superintendent
to discuss the ﬁrst version of the IEP. (Exh. P—49)

During the June 26, 2009 meeting, the Parent also complained that there was no OT/PT services, no
ESY services, and no assistive technology listed on the IEP, despite all that the Parent and other service

providers had done at and before the meeting to secure them. (Exh. P~121)

The Parent told the administrators that the proposed objectives to remediate the Student’s syntax had

been proven to fail. She also communicated her concerns regarding the invalidity of the CELF— 3 and
that it was administered without consent. The Superintendent told the Parent that the IEP would not be
changed except for adding in OT sewices and ESY services. (Exh. P-49) ‘

On July 1, July 2, and July 13, 2009, the Parent faxed a letter to the Board rejecting the proposed IEP.
She outlined the services that she planned to provide for the Student along with his placement at SSA.
The Parent stated that she expected that these expenses would be at public expense — including the cost
of the placement at SSA. (Exhs. P—52, P—54, P—56)

Thereafter, the Parent sent several letters to the Board advising it of related services that she planned to
secure and that she expected them to be paid at public expense. The Parent also sent copies of progress
reports, repoﬁ cards, and evaluations to the Board as well as three letters asking it to clarify and/or
correct claimed factual inaccuracies on the June 17, 2009 IEP. (Exhs. P—59, P—60, P-62, P-66, P—67, P—
69, P—70, P—72, P—75, P—76, P-82, P-92, P—100)

On Januaiy 7, 2010, Janet Campbell, an Orton Gillingham Practitioner, evaluated the Student and
provided recommendations. Pursuant thereto, Ms. Campbell stated that “because [the Student] receives
no Special Education services during his private school day, it is imperative that his signiﬁcant reading
and spelling skill gaps continue to be aggressively addressed outside of school, at such a rate of
intensity that [the Student] achieves grade-level parity with his peers as soon as possible.” (Exh. P—72)

On April 8, 2010, Dr. Kemper performed a full Psycholinguistic Reevaluation on the Student. Dr.
Kemper noted meaningﬁll progress regarding spontaneous communicative discourse, pragmatic skills,
and phonemic decoding. Since beginning at SSA, Dr. Kemper opined that the Student was now able to
early on a conversation with the Examiner. The Student was noted to be “fairly successful in using
appropriate grammar and syntax when formulating sentences during routine communicative discourse
interactions.” Dr. Kemper opined that the Student did not Inake gains in written expression, despite
approximately 6.5 hours of high quality, individual language therapy. Dr. Kemper continued to
recommend that the Student be educated within the context of a small, student/teacher ratio program, in
which he is familiar, and feels comfoﬁable “with participating across a variety of communicative
contexts without fear of verbal competition.” He recommended 7.5 hours of language therapy by a
qualiﬁed, experienced clinician in expressive language disorders. (Exh. P—Sl)

On J une 30, 2010, the Parent notiﬁed the Board that it had not offered any ESY services for 2010 and
that she would be providing them. She expected that these services would be at public expense. (Exh.
P—93)

On July 11, 2010, the Parent refaxed the June 30, 2010 letter. (Exh. P—94)

On August 15, 2010, the Parent provided written notice to the Board that she would be providing
placement at SSA with speciﬁed related services for the 2010-2011 school year at public expense. (Exh.
P-98)

SSA is a regular education facility with a 6.5 hour school day, which includes Judaic Studies for
approximately 2.0 hours per day - or one third of the program. SSA provides no special education
programs, does not develop or implement IEPs, and does not employ staff certiﬁed to teach special
education students. No IEP goals and objectives have been implemented for the Student at SSA. The

Student received only “pull-out” speech and language therapy and Orton—Gillingham tutoring from
private service providers for approximately one—third of the school day. The pullout services are not
during the 2.0 hours of daily religious instruction. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg, Testimony Parent
12/1/10, Testimony Dr. Kemper; Exhs. B—37, P-85)

Karen Rosenberg has been the head of SSA since 1989. She has never had a full—time teaching position
prior thereto. She has been a substitute teacher in various schools as well as acting as a tutor. She
holds no certiﬁcations in the State of Connecticut. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg)

Ms. Rosenberg is responsible for the curriculum at SSA and its day to day operation. She teaches level
four math and sixth grade organization. Sixth grade is the highest grade at SSA. (Testimony Ms.
Rosenberg)

Approximately one-third of the school day is devoted to Judaic studies at SSA. The school day is from
8:30 am. to 3:00 pm. , with a lunch break of forty—ﬁve minutes to one hour. (Testimony Ms.
Rosenberg)

There are twenty-eight regular students and four pre—k students at 88A There are three full time
instructors of which one teaches Judaic studies, and the other three teach secular subjects. There are
also up to twenty staff members who are paIt-time. One teacher is certiﬁed by the State; the other let
her certiﬁcation lapse. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg)

Ms. Rosenberg is not familiar with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. SSA does not provide a 504 Plan
but has participated in the planning of such Plans when a student is being transitioned to public school.
(Testimony Ms. Rosenberg)

The Student’s curriculum at SSA is the same as all other students. However, SSA may shorten some of
the Student’s assignments. The Student is “out of the school for a celtain amount of tutoring, and, last
year, he was missing a chunk of social studies.” ln order to prevent the Student falling behind, the
teacher worked with him individually in social studies. The Student continues to miss social studies
due to being pulled out for tutoring. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg)

The Student attends Spanish at SSA once per week, although the class meets twice per week. This is
provided by SSA as an accommodation since the Student is pulled out of SSA for his specialized
tutoring. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg)

The Student also misses art, one period of math, and computer due to being picked up by his Parent for
specialized instruction. The Student is poor at word processing. The computer class would teach
computer skills such as keyboarding. The Student misses this instruction. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg)

SSA does not provide Oiton-Gillingham tutoring 01' any other kind of reading tutoring that was
different than that provided to any other student. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg)

When the Student is pulled out, the Parent picks him up on Mondays at approximately noon and he is
gone for the rest of the day. He is also pulled out on Thursdays from just before lunch and returns for
the last class of the day — approximately 11:30 to 2:00 pm. When he returns, the teacher transitions the
Student back. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg)

The Student is affected by these transitions into and out of the classroom. However, this has occurred
since the beginning of his attendance at SSA. The other students are used to him coming and going.
There is no profound affect on the Student and he does not seem anxious about it. However, he is
anxious if the Parent is late. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg)

1f the Student were enrolled in the East Lyme Public Schools, any such pull outs for sewices would be
accomplished in a manner to prevent any disruption and would not interfere with the Student’s ability to
receive other instruction, including special education sewices, as provided by the IEP. (Testimony Mix
Reas)

The Student is in a small class at SSA. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg)

According to the Student’s 2009-2010 Repelt Card from SSA, he made satisfactmy progress in most
areas, and is noted to be “outstanding” in participation. He needs improvement in areas involving work
habits and is “progressing” in many other areas. He is also noted to have been absent 7 days for the ﬁrst
and second marking period; and tardy 45 days. (Testimony Ms. Rosenberg; Exh. B—36)

During the 2008—2009, 2009—2010, and 2010-2011 school years, the Student has both progressed and
regressed in his educational program. He is and has been a member of the school basketball team, a
member of the school choir, and performed with the choir last year at the State Capitol. (Testimony
Ms.Rosenbei'g; Exhs. P—37, P-85, P-124)

J anet Campbell is certiﬁed to provide Oi'ton-Gillingham instruction and began working with the
Student, at the Parent’s request, in July 2009. Ms. Campbell has been working with the Student three
times per week for one hour individual sessions at his home. The Student is serious, responsible, and
diligent in these sessions. (Testimony Ms. Campbell)

Based upon her work with the Student, Ms. Campbell maintains that he requires individualized, not
group instruction. (Testimony Ms. Campbell)

Ms. Campbell asserts that the goals and objectives on the J une 17, 2009 TEP are not appropriate for the
Student’s reading needs. It lacks phonics or oral ﬂuency goals. Oral ﬂuency needs to be a goal for
somebody who reads less quickly than others to gradually improve on that. (Testimony Ms. Campbell).

As regards accuracy, the Students cun‘ently reads at an early fouith grade level. In terms of fluency, he
is at the third grade level. His spelling is early to mid second grade level. (Testimony Ms. Campbell)

Brian Reas is the Assistant Superintendent for Special Education and Pupil Personnel for the Board,
and has held that position since July 1, 2010. He was formerly the Director of Support Sewices, which
includes Special Education for the East Hampton Public Schools. As an educator, he was a special
education teacher with a focus on learning disabilities and set up the program for Autism within the
school to which he was assigned. (Testimony MI. Reas)

The Board requires that special education staff be certiﬁed by the State of Connecticut, including
training aﬁei‘ being hired which requires approximately three to four years. Staff are also trained as
regards Oiton-Gillingham techniques. (Testimony Mr. Reas)

The Board is able to provide the Student with FAPE if the Student were enrolled. (Testimony Mr.
Reas)

The Student excels in ceitain academic areas. The Board has qualiﬁed teachers in the upper grades,
which SSA does not. Hence, the Board may be in a better position than SSA to accommodate the areas
in which the Student excels. (Testimony Mr. Reas)

Pursuant to the June 2009 IEP, the Student would be pulled out ﬁfty minutes daily for reading, two and
one-half hours per week for speech and language, and one hour for social behavioral goals. Twenty
minutes per week for adaptive PE. would be done in the regular classroom. The Student would also
receive one hour per week of OT. (Testimony Mr. Reas)

When the Student would be pulled out for reading, the goal is to provide the Student with reading that
is specialized in addition to the reading that’s provided in the classroom. When coordinating the
Student’s pull out, this is often done during transition times and other oppottunities that the Student
may be pulled out without hunting his/her ability to get reading instruction in class. Pull outs are
performed to avoid the Student missing classroom participation or any palticular classroom activity on
a regular basis. This is coordinated between the special education teacher and the regular education
teacher. The Board ensures that the students still receive the whole program. (Testimony Mr. Reas)

The Board has a no bullying policy. (Testimony of Mr. Reas)

SSA is a private, religious school that is located in the New London Public School District and is
outside the Board’s District. (Testimony Mr. Reas)

The Board is not required to reimburse the Parent for related expenses, including
ti'ansp01tation.

Insufﬁcient evidence was submitted upon which to ﬁnd that the Board should pay for evaluations,
consultations, and attendance at PPT’s by either Dr. Kemper 01‘ Geraldine Theodore. The Parent did
not argue this issue in her closing brief and appeared to have abandoned it.

Whether the IEP of 12/18/08 constitutes a stay-put placement was neither argued nor was evidence
submitted regarding such claim. The issue was moot.

The Board did not fail to convene a properly constituted PPT. (Exhs. B—S, B-1 5, B—35)

Insufﬁcient evidence was submitted upon which to base a claim that the Board failed to properly draft
the 2009 IEP. The Parent did not argue this issue in her closing brief. (Exh. B-35)

The Board considered all appropriate evaluations at the PPTs. (Testimony Dr. Kempei‘; Exhs. B—8, b-
15, B-35)

The Board has not conducted an annual review, proposed a program, or held a PPT for the 2010-201 1
school year.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The Student qualiﬁes for, and is entitled to receive, a free and appropriate pubic education with special
education and related services under the provisions of state and federal laws. CGS §10—76, et seq. and
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) 20 U.S.C. §1401, et seq. The Student’s
identiﬁed disability is Autism.

LDEA opens the door of public education to children with disabilities. Board of

Educ 0f the Hendrick Hudson Cent Sch. Dist. v, Rowley, 458 U .S. 176, 192 (1982). Under IDEA, a
local education association ("LEA"), such as the Board, must provide to each qualifying student a free
appropriate public education (“FAPE”) in the least restrictive environment (“LRE”), including special
education and related services. 20 U.S.C.§1401(18).

The putpose 0f LDEA is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them FAPE that
emphasizes special education and related sewices designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them
for further education, employment and independent living” and to ”ensure that the rights ofchildi'en
with disabilities and parents of such children are protected 1 . ." 20 U.S.C. §1400 (d)(1).

An “appropriate” education is one that is reasonably calculated to confer some educational beneﬁt. See
Board ofEduc. ofthe Hendrick Hudson Central Sch. Dist v. Rowley, 458 US. 176, 206-7 (1982);
Walczak v. Florida Union Free Sch. Disl. 142 F.3d 119,130 (2d Cir. 1998).

“Special Education” means: “specially designed instruction at no cost to parents to meet the unique
needs ofa child with a disability.” 20 U.S.C. §1401(25).

“Related Services” means: transportation, and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive
services (including speech/language pathology and audiology services, psychological services, physical
and occupational therapy, recreation, including therapeutic recreation, social work sewices, counseling
services, including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical services,
except that such medical services shall be for diagnostic and evaluation purposes only) as may be
required to assist a child with a disability to beneﬁt from special education, including the early
identiﬁcation and assessment of disabling conditions in children. 20 U.S.C. §1401 (22).

The standard for determining whether FAPE has been provided is set forth

in Rowley, supra. The two—pronged inquily is ﬁrst, whether the procedural requirements of IDEA have
been met and second, whether the IEP is “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive
educational beneﬁts.” Rowley, supra, at 206-207.

The second prong of Rowley requires a ﬁndings that the IEP is "i'easonably calculated to enable the
child to receive educational benefit." The Supreme Court, has made clear that "appropriate“ under the
IDEA does not require that the school districts "maximize the potential of handicapped children."
Walczak v. Florida Union Free School District, 142 F.3d 199, 130 (2d. Cir.1998)), citing Rowley,
supra. Rather, school districts are required to provide, as the ”basic ﬂoor of opportunity . . . access to
specialized services which are individually designed to provide educational beneﬁt to the handicapped

January 10,2011 14 Final Decision and Order 11-0143

child." Rowley, supra, 458 US. at 201; see also KP. v. Juzwic, 891 F. Supp. 703, 718 (D.Conn. 1995)
(Goal of IDEA is to provide access to public education for disabled students, not to maximize a special
education child's potential). In this Circuit, the Court of Appeals has said that the proper gage for
determining educational progress is “whether the educational progi'am provided for a child is reasonably
calculated to allow the child to receive "meaningful” educational beneﬁts." Ms. B. v. Milford Board of
Education, 103 F.3d 1114, 1120 (2d Cir.1997). The Court of Appeals has also cautioned that
meaningful educational beneﬁts are "not everything that might be thought desirable by loving parents.
Tucker v. Bay Shore Union Free School Dist, 873 F .2d 563, 567 (2nd Cii‘.1989). “Clearly, Congress
did not intend that a school system could discharge its duty under the [IDEA] by providing a program
that produces some minimal academic advancement, no matter how trivial." Hal] v. Vance County Bd
of Educ., 774 F.2d 629, 636 (4th Cir.1985). "Of course, a child's academic progress must be viewed in
light of the limitations imposed by the child's disability." Ms. B. v. Milford, supra at 1 121. When
determining the appropriateness of a given placement courts will also consider evidence of a student's
progress in that placement.

Here, the record establishes that the June 2008 IEP offered FAPE to the Student.

The Parent failed to alert the PPT that she in any way disputed this provision. Instead, the Parent, who
had already entered into discussions with SSA for enrollment in the fall, chose to unilaterally place the
Student at SSA.

The December 2008 IEP was draﬁed to transition the Student from Hope to SSA. It was intended as a
supplement to the services the Parent had already decided to obtain. The Parent chose and agreed to
pay for the tuition at SSA.

The June 17, 2009 IEP provides for a Case Manager with weekly meetings, Code Emphasis with Onton-
Gillingham for ﬁfty minutes daily, speech and language of 2.5 hours per week, OT of 1 hour per week,
PT/AT of twenty minutes per week, and ESY for 2009. With the exception of the PT/AT, the Student
would be pulled out and receive small group 01‘ individual instruction. The Board proposed that this
program be provided at Niantic Center School or the home school of Flanders elementaiy. No evidence
was provided that either of these two schools would be inappropriate. In fact, according to Dr.
Berglund’s representations during the June 17, 2009 PPT, Niantic Center School is small and staffed
with a highly qualiﬁed special education teacher. The Parent’s witnesses had not observed either of
these schools and had no knowledge of the proposed program.

The record establishes that the Board thereby offered FAPE to the Student. Although Dr. Kempei‘
opined that the Student requires a private day placement since he looks different and would be subject
to bullying, this was not persuasive,

In order to ensure that the balance of services required to meet these goals is speciﬁcally ﬁtted to the
particular child, the IDEA requires that each child receive an Individualized Education Program. The
IEP is intended to be “the result of collaborations between parents, educators, and the representatives of
the school district." Lillbask v. Connecticut Dep't of Educ. 397 F.3d 77, 2005 US. App. LEXIS 1655
(2d Cir.Feb. 2, 2005). While the IEP does not have to maximize the child's educational potential it
must provide "meaningﬁJl" opportunities and the possibility for more than ‘trivial advancement."
Walczak 142 F.3d at 130. .

The Parent contended that she was denied an opportunity to participate in the PPT process. The record,

January 10, 2011 15 Final Decision and Order 11-0143

10.

11.

13.

however, does not suppott this claim. There were PPTs held on June 12, 2008, December 18, 2008,
and June 17, 2009. The Parent was afforded a full opportunity to participate as we11 as to provide
information regarding evaluations that were performed.

The IEP selves as the centerpiece of a student's entitlement to special education

under the IDEA. Ham'g v. Doe, 484 US. 305, 311 (1988). The primaly safeguard is the obligatoty
development of an IEP which must contain a statement of the child‘s current educational performance,
including how his disability affects his involvement and progress in the general curriculum, and a
statement of "measurable annual goals, including academic and functional goals, designed to (aa) meet
the child's needs that result from the child‘s disability to enable the child to be involved in and make
progress in the general education curriculum; and (bb) meet each of the child's other educational needs
that result from the child's disability." 20 U.S.C, §1414(d)(1)(A)(ii); 34 CFR §300.320(a)(2)(l); Roland
M V. Concord School Committee, 910 F.2d 983, 987 (lst Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 US. 912 (1991).

In developing an IEP, the PPT must consider the strengths of the child, the

concerns of the parents, the results of the initial or most recent evaluations, and the academic,
developmental, and functional needs of the child. 34 CFR §300.324(a)(1). Courts must also consider
whether the program is "individualized on the basis of the student's assessment and performance” when
determining the appropriateness of an IEP. See A.S, v. Board of Education of West Hartford, 35 IDELR
179 (D.Conn. 2001), aff‘d 47 Fed. Appx. 615 (2d Cii‘.2002) (citing MC. ex rel. Ms. C. v. Voluntown Ba’.
ofEduc., 122 F. Supp. 2d 289, 292 n.6 (D.C0nn. 2000).

Both Dr. Kemper and Ms. Rosenberg paiticipated in the December 18, 2008 PPT. Dr. Kemper, Ms.
Rosenberg, and Ms. Theodore palticipated in the June 17, 2009 PPT. The PPT considered the
evaluations and input of each of these participants.

The IEP must set forth goals and objectives which provide a mechanism to determine whether the
placement and sewices are enabling the child to make educational progress. 20 U.S.C. §1401(a)(20).
Connecticut courts have determined that in order for an IEP to be found appropriate, it must provide
more than mere trivial advancement, it must be one that is " . . . likely to produce progress, not regress."
Mrs. B. v. Milford B.O.E., 103 F.2d 1114, 1121 (2d Cir 1997). The student's capabilities, intellectual
progress and what the LEA has offered must be considered along with grade promotions and test scores
in determining whether the program offered is reasonably calculated to confer a nontrivial or
meaningful educational beneﬁt to the child. See. Hall v. Vance County Bd. of Ed. 774 F.2d 629, 635
(1985). Objective factors such as passing marks and advancement from grade to grade can be
indicators of meaningful educational beneﬁts but are not in and of themselves dispostiive. See. Mrs. B.
v. MilfordBd. ofEa’. 103 F.3d 1120, (2d Cir. 1997).

In order for a given alleged procedural violation to be considered sufﬁciently signiﬁcant to render
invalid a proposed IEP, a procedural violation must have resulted in a denial of FAPE to the student.
IDEA provides:

(I) In general, Subject to clause (ii), a decision made by a hearing ofﬁcer shall be made on
substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public
education.

(ii) Procedural issues. In matters alleging a procedural Violation, a hearing ofﬁcer may ﬁnd that a
child did not receive a free appropriate public education only if the procedural inadequacies --

January 10, 201 1 16 Final Decision and Order 1 1-0143

14.

15.

16.

(I) impeded the child's right to a free appropriate public education;
(11) signiﬁcantly impeded the parent’s opportunity to palticipate in the decision-lnaking process
regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education to the parent's child; or
(III) caused a deprivation of educational beneﬁts.
(iii) Rule of construction. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude a

hearing ofﬁcer from ordering a local educational agency to comply with procedural
requirements under this subsection.

20 U.S.C. §1415(f)(3)(E); 34 CFR§300.513. As comts within this circuit have held subsequent to the
2004 amendments, "[p]rocedu1‘a1 ﬂaws do not automatically require a ﬁnding of a denial of FAPE"
Matrejek v. Brewster Cent. Sch. Dist. 471 F.Supp. 415, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2007); see also "M" v. Ridgeﬁeld
Bd. ofEduc. No. 3:05-CV584 (RNC), 2007 US. Dist. LEXIS 24691, at #21n. 8 (D.Gonn. Mar. 30,
2007) (citing cases from various circuits that held that a plaintiff must demonstrate that procedural
errors by the district resulted in the denial of a FAPE). "Only procedural inadequacies that cause
substantial harm to the child or his parents -— meaning that the individual 01‘ cumulative result is the loss
of educational opportunity or seriously infringe on a parent's participation in the creation or formulation
of the IEP - constitute a denial of a FAPE." Mattrejek, supra, at 419.

None of the alleged procedural violations were sufﬁciently signiﬁcant to result in a denial oi‘FAPE t0
the Student.

Procedural safeguards are set forth in 20 U.S.C. §1415 and 34 CFR §§300.500, et seq.. Failure by the
Board to develop an IEP in accordance with procedures mandated by IDEA, in and of itself, can be
deemed a denial of FAPE. Amanda .1. ex rel Annette J, v. Clark County Sch.Dist., 267 F.3d 877, 9th Cir

(2001).

If the parent obtains an independent educational evaluation at public expense or shares with the public
agency an evaluation obtained at private expense, the results of the evaluation “must be considered by
the public agency, if it meets agency criteria, in any decision made with respect to the provision of
FAPE t0 the child;” (emphasis added.) 34 CFR §300.502(c), 20 U.S.C. §§1415(b)(1) and (d)(2)(A).
According to the record, Dr. Kempei‘ and Ms. Rosenberg participated in the December 18, 2008 PPT.
Dr. Kemper, Ms. Rosenberg, and Ms. Theodore participated in the June 17, 2009 PPT. At each PPT
their input was considered. Dr. Kemper chose to not provide the Board with a copy of his evaluation
since the Board did not pay for it. However, the evidence established that he was afforded a full
opportunity to participate and for the Parent to provide copies of such eva1uations.

A Board may not predetermine a placement for a student with a disability and must come to the table
with an open mind and consider the unique needs of the child. Deal v. Hamilton County Bd. qud, 42
IDELR 109 (6th Cir. 2004) Participation of Parents must be more than a mere form; it must be
meaningful. W.Gt, 960 F.2d at 1485; see also Knox County Sch, 315 F.3d at 694-95. The
preponderance of the evidence establishes that the Parent failed to advise the PPT that she desired a
different placement. Instead, the Parent began discussions with SSA to enroll the Student there even
prior to the June 2008 PPT. The Parent predetermined that she was so enrolling the Student. The June
17, 2009 PPT minutes indicate that the Board considered an alternative placement at Niantic Center
School 01' would offer the Parent the option of having the program provided at the local elementaiy
school.

The Board has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the program for the 2008—
2009, 2009-2010, and 2010-201 1 school years, and ESY for 2009 and 2010 were appropriate. RCSA
§10—76h-14(a). See also, Walczak v. Florida Union Free Sch. Dist., 142 F.3d 119, 122 (2d Cir. 1998).
The Board met its burden of proof as regards the 2008—2009 and 2009-2010 school years. The Board
also met its burden of proof as regards ESY for 2009. No evidence was presented that the Board held a
PPT 01‘ proposed a program for the 2010-2011 school year or ESY for 2010. The Board did not conduct
an annual review for 2010-201 1, The Parent asserted throughout the hearing that she had an agreement
with Mr. Buck that the Board would reserve the Hope 2008—2009 placement until the Parent was able to
determine whether SSA was acceptable alter the Student had an opportunity to attend. The Parent
thereby impliedly, if not expressly, conceded that Hope was acceptable absent her being satisﬁed with
SSA and that the 2008-2009 IEP offered FAPE.

Generally, ESY is provided for a Student in order to prevent the amount of gains achieved by a Student
from being jeopardized Student v. Preston B.0.E., CT DOE Case No. 06-109, p. 10 (12/27/06); MM
by DM & E.M. v. Sch. Dist. ofGreenville County, 37 IDELR 183 (4th Cir. 2002); JH. by JD. & SS.
v. [-lem'ico County Sch. Bd., 38 IDELR 261 (4th Cir. 2003). An ESY program cannot be arbitrarily
limited by the Board. 1d,; 34 CFR §300.309 (a)(3)(ii). The Board met its burden of proof that the 2009
ESY program provided FAPE. The Parent failed to offer any persuasive evidence upon which to base
a claim that the Board failed to do so.

Pursuant to 34 CFR §300.342 (a), at the beginning of each school year the public agency shall have an
IEP in effect for each child with a disability within its jurisdiction.

The least restrictive environment does not trump the requirement that a

child receive FAPE. If a child’s placement does not provide “signiﬁcant learning” or “meaningful
beneﬁt” to the child, and a more restrictive program is likely to provide such beneﬁt, then the child is
entitled to be placed in that more restrictive program. See Dighton—Rehobath Regional Sch. Dist. 4
ECLPR 721 (SEA MS 2006).

The federal law requires that handicapped children be educated with their non-disabled peers to the
maximum extent appropriate. 20 U.S.C. §1412(a)(5); 34 CFR §300.114. However, a district must
make any placement and service decisions for a child based on their individual needs. 20 U.S.C.
1401(29); 34 CFR§300.39, see also Oberti v. Board of Education of Borough ofClementon School
District, 995 F.2d 1204,1214 (3d Cir. 1993). A comparison must be made between the educational
beneﬁts the child will receive in the regular classroom and the beneﬁts the child will receive in a
segregated program. Id. at 1220. A segregated setting may be the most appropriate and least restrictive
environment for a student. Connecticut Final Decision and Order 00-180, Conclusion of Law No.6
(November 30, 2000) (citing De Vries v. F(Iiijﬁlx County School Board, 882 F.2d 876 (Cir. 1989)).
Where a student demonstrates stagnant or negative progress in the mainstream, a private placement that
provides appropriate supports and services for the student to make progress becomes the least restrictive
environment. WM. and KM. v, Southern Regional Ed. afEduc., 46 IDELR 101 (D.NJ. 2006), see
also, .10 v. N. KC. Dept. 0fEduc., 550 F.Supp.2d 420 (D.NY 2008). It is well settled that the least
restrictive environment for a child depends on his unique needs.

Whether the parents of a disabled child are entitled to reimbursement for the costs of a private school
turns on two distinct questions: ﬁrst, whether the challenged IEP was adequate to provide the child with
FAPE; and second, whether the private educational services obtained by the parents were appropriate to

January 10, 2011 18 Final Decision and Order ”—0143

22.

23.

24.

the child’s needs. Only if a court determines that a challenged IEP was inadequate should it proceed to
the second question. M C, ex rel. Mrs. C. V Valzmtown Bd. 0fEd., 226 F.3d 60, 66 (2d Cir. 2000)

When it is determined that the Board’s program is inappropriate, the parent

is entitled to reimbursement if the parent’s private school placement is appropriate. Burlington School
Committee v. Department afEducalion, 471 U.S. 359 (1985). In placing the Student at Solomon
Schecter, the Parent made a unilateral placement. The Board argues that SSA fails to provide the
services necessaiy for the Student including, but not limited to, a special education teacher in the
classroom, among other things. Sch. Comm. OfTown ame'lington v. Dept. of Educ. Mass, 471 U.S.
359, 370 (1985); Tatro v, State ofTexas, 703 F.2d 823 (5th Cir. 1983), aft’d 468 U.S. 883 (1984).

As set fo1th hereinabove, even if the Board’s program was inappropriate, SSA provides no special
education services whatsoever, does not implement the IEP, and the teachers are not special education
cettiﬁed. The Student was routinely removed from SSA at noon on Mondays, and from 11:30 am. —
2:00 pm. on Thursdays. Fulther, he had to endure transitions on Thursdays which impacted the
Student at various times and degrees. On Mondays, he was removed from the School and wholly
missed computer instruction, social studies, and 2111. The only beneﬁt to the Student is the small class
s1ze.

The Board contends that it is barred from paying SSA as such payment would have the impermissible
effect of advancing religion. The Board contends that this would violate the Establishment Clause.
The Board is correct that SSA consists of one—third religious studies — which was actually more than
one-third for the Student since he was removed from regular class instruction, that was not religious, in
order to receive outside special education instruction. However, it is not necessary to reach this issue
since SSA is determined to be an inappropriate placement on other grounds. (See Final Decision and
Order 07046, Hearing Ofﬁcer Strong, attached to Student’s Brief). Notably, the record establishes that
the Parent also does not believe the program is appropriate as regards its ability to implement the IEP.
The Parent has been utilizing the services of private practitioners to provide the necessary special
education services to the Student — outside of SSA — and totally separate and distinct from it.

Parents seeking an alternative placement are not subject to the same mainstreaming requirements as a
school board. MS. Ex rel SS. v. Board ofEducation offhe Cily of Yonkers, 33 IDELR 183 (2nd Cir.
2000) citing Warren G. V. Cumberland County School District, 190 F.3d 80, 84 (3d Cir.1999). In
selecting a unilateral placement, parents are not held to the same standards as are school systems
Florence County Sch. Dist, V. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 114 S.Ct. 361, 126 L.Ed. 2d 284 (1993). It is well
settled that the unilateral placement does not have to meet the standards of a least restrictive
environment (LRE), nor does the unilateral placement have to include certiﬁed instmctors in special
education 34 CFR §300.403(c), MS ex rel S.. v Board ofEducation of the City of Yonkers 33 IDELR
183 (2nd Cir. 2000) citing Warren g. v. Cumberland County School District, 190 F.3d 80, 84 (3d
Cir.1999). The test is whether the parents’ private placement is appropriate, and not that it is perfect.
As set fo1th above, SSA is not appropriate.

Compensatory education is the “replacement of educational sewices the child should have received in
the ﬁrst place” and should “elevate [the Student] to the position he would have occupied absent the
school board’s failures. Reia1 ex rel. Reid v, Board of Columbia, 401 F.3d 516, 518, 524-27 (DC. Cir.
2005). Hearing Ofﬁcers have the authority to provide compensatory education as an equitable remedy
for denial of FAPE. Student v. Greenwich B. OE. , CT DOE Case No. 06-005 at 19; Inquiry ofKahn, 17

EHLR 522 (OSEP) (2/ 13/91) (citing with approval Lester H. v. Gi/hool, 916 F.2d 865 (3d Cir. 1990);
Burr v. Ambach, 863 F.2d 1071 (2d Cir. 1988), vacated, 492 US. 902, reaff’d, 888 F.2d 258 (2d Cir.
1989). Compensatory education has been recognized as an available remedy under IDEA for failure of
the Board to provide FAPE. See, KP, v. Juzwic, 891 F.Supp. 703 (D.Conn. 1995); Burr v. Ambach, 863
F.2d 1071 (2d Cir. 1988); Mrs. C. v. Wheatarl, 916 F.2d 69 (2d Cir. 1990). The Parent has failed to
identify what compensatory services are sought. The Parent unilaterally enrolled the Student at SSA
which provides no special education services and she contracted to obtain ceitain services privately.
The Parent did not advise the Board in writing that she desired a private day placement other than Hope
at the June 2008 PPT or prior to such placement. To the contrary, she indicated that she intended to
enroll and maintain the Student at SSA, and accepted ﬁnancial responsibility therefore. Signiﬁcantly,
the Parent also agreed with Mr. Buck that the Board would reserve the placement at Hope Academy for
fall 2008 in case the SSA placement did not work out. Accordingly, she impliedly, if not expressly,
also acknowledged that Hope would be an appropriate placement if SSA did not work out.

The cost of reimbursement may be reduced or denied if at the most recent PPT Team meeting that the
parents attended prior to removal of the child from the public school, the parents did not inform the IEP
T eam that they were rejecting the placement proposed by the public agency to provide FAPE to the
child including stating their concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a private school at public
expense; or at least ten business days prior to the removal of the child from the public school the
parents did not give written notice to the public agency. 34 CFR §§300.148(d), el seq., 20
U.S.C.§1412(a)(10)(c). The Board argues that the Parent failed to provide appropriate Notice of intent
to remove the Student from the public school. The Parent contends that the Board was fully aware, and
that she was advised by Mr. Buck not to put the request in writing so that the Board could reserve the
placement at Hope in case it did not work out. Failure to provide such Notice is not in and of itself, a
bar to reimbursement. However, as set forth hereinabove, it is not necessary to reach the issue of Notice
to the Board as the placement at SSA was so inappropriate so as to deny the Parent’s request for
reimbursement.

The Parent is requesting reimbursement for evaluations and services privately obtained. No evidence
was presented during the hearing on this issue nor was this issue pursued. It is also unclear to which
evaluations and services this refers. Nonetheless, in order to seek reimburse for private evaluations, the
Parent was required to request an independent education evaluation at public expense, the Board must
either ﬁle a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate, or
ensure that an independent educational evaluation is provided at public expense. 34 CFR.§300.502; 20
U.S.C.§1415(b)(1) and (d)(2)(A). There is no evidence that such request was made to the Board, hence,
the Parent is not entitled to reimbursement.

Parentally-placed private school children with disabilities means children with disabilities enrolled by
their parents in private, including religious, schools or facilities. 34 CFR §300.130; 20
U.S.C.§1412(a)(10)(A). When the Parent enrolled the Student at SSA and maintained that enrollment,
it constituted such a placement within the meaning of 34 CFR §300.130; 20 U.S.C. §1412(a)(10)(A).

A service plan must be developed and implemented for each private school child with a disability who
has been designated by the LEA in which the private school is located to receive special education and

related services under this part. 34 CFR.§300.132; 20 U.S.C. §l412(a)(10)(A)(i).

No parentally—placed private school child with a disability has an individual right to receive some or all

0f the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in public school 34
CFR §300.132; 20 U.S.C. §1412(a)(10)(A)(i). Parentally—placed private school children with
disabilities may receive a different amount of services than children with disabilities in public schools.
34 CFR §300.138; 20 U.S.C. §1412(a)(10)(A)(Vi). Due process is not applicable except for child ﬁnd.
