FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUE:

Whether the Board’s evaluations of the Student are appropriate.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:

This request for hearing was submitted by the Board on November 23, 2011 and a prehearing
conference convened on December 2. 2011. At the prehearing conference, the Board’s attorney
confirmed that the Parents had withdrawn their request for an IEE at this time. Because the
Parents did not withdraw their request with prejudice, the district withdrew its request without
prejudice in the event that the Parents renew their request for an IEE. Therefore, this case is
dismissed, without prejudice.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED, without prejudice.
