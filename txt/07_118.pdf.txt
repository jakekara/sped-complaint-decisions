 PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
 The Parents&#8482; attorney requested this hearing on May 1, 2007 by letter to the State Department of Education (SDE).  Hearing Offi
cer (HO) Exhibit 1.  The Darien Board of Education received the request on May 2, 2007.  This
 Hearing Officer was assigned to the case 
on that date.  Attys. Freedman and Goodman f
iled an appearance for the Board on May 4.  On 
May 10, the Board filed a Motion to Contest Sufficiency and Strike.  A prehearing conference was held on May 11, 2007.  The parties reported that a resolution meeting was scheduled on May 
16.  The decision deadline was established as July 16, 2007.  The Parents&#8482; attorney stated that he needed seven days for their side of the case.  Th
e Board&#8482;s attorney estimated five days would be 
needed.  Hearing dates were agreed on for July 17, 19, 23 and 24.  The Parents&#8482; attorney agreed to send a written request to extend the decision deadline until August 21, 2007.  He also stated that he would file a response to the Board&#8482;s motion on May 
14, which he did.  He also wrote a letter to the Hearing Officer stating that the Pare
nts wished to have a decision within the original 45-day timeline and did not want to extend it.  
On May 15, the Board filed an objection to the Parents&#8482; request to maintain the original decision deadline, arguing that their attorney had made 
an agreement to extend it at the prehearing conf
erence.  On May 16, the Hearing Officer issued a 
ruling on the Board&#8482;s motion, finding the complaint met the sufficiency requirements of the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and granting 
the motion to strike various paragraphs of the complaint.  The Parents&#8482; attorney was directed to file an amended complaint in 

accordance with the ruling by May 25.  In view of 
the Parents&#8482; decision not to waive the 45-day 
timeline, the Hearing Officer ordered that each pa
rty would be limited to one day to present their 
cases, unless the attorneys agreed to the July dates.
  If they did not inform the Hearing Officer of an agreement by May 30, two June dates would be
 scheduled.  The Parents would have June 14 and the Board June 25.   No agreement on July dates was made.  
 On May 23, the Parents&#8482; attorney filed an amended complaint, which added new claims 
pertaining to the 2005-06 school year and added numerous facts 
and claims pertaining to the
