FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Were the District evaluations which were presented at the July 15, 2016 Planning and
Placement Team meeting appropriate?

2. If the District evaluations were not appropriate, are Parents entitled to an Independent

evaluation at public expense?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On November 30, 2016, the Parent received a request for a special education due process hearing
ﬁled by the Board of Education. On December 1, 2016, the Connecticut State Department of
Education appointed the undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer to preside over the matter. During the

Febmai‘y 3, 2017 were set and the deadline for mailing the ﬁnal decision and order was
established as January 13, 2017. A request for an extension of the mailing deadline was jointly
requested by the parties on December 13, 2016 in order to accommodate the agreed upon hearing
date schedule. This request was granted and resulted in a new mailing deadline of February 10,
2017. On J anuary 6, 2017, the Attorney for the Student withdrew her request for an Independent
