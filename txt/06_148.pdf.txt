  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  ISSUES:  1. Is Student eligible for special education? 
 2. If so, what are an appropriate Individualized Education Program and placement 
for her? 
  PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  This hearing was requested on June 5, 2006, and the hearing officer was appointed the same day.  A pre-hearing conference by c
onference telephone call was held on June 20, 2006.  The parties planned to seek mediation. 
 In the event that mediation might not 
succeed, the hearing was scheduled for August 1, 2006.  The deadline for mailing the 

final decision and order was set for August 19, 2006.    On August 1, the Parent contacted the Due Process Unit asking that the hearing be postponed because of a health problem.  The 
hearing was re-scheduled for September 7, 
2006.  The deadline for mailing the final decision and order was extended from August 

19 to September 18, 2006.    On September 7, Parent telephoned the Direct
or of Special Education for the Board, 
again requesting a postponement.  The conversat
ion included a review of the issues in dispute, and the Director later reported to the hearing officer that all current issues had been resolved and that the request for hearing was being withdrawn.
