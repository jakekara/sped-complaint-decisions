    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  Issues:  1.  Was the Board&#8482;s multidisciplinary evaluation appropriate? 
 2.  If not, what evaluations would be appropriate?  
  Procedural History/Summary:  During the fall and winter of the 2003-2004 school year, a multidisciplinary evaluation 
was administered to the Student to determine the nature of her educational difficulties 
which were most significant in the area of math.  After the Student received scores in the 
average range on most of the tested areas, the Board determined that no further testing 

was necessary and that the Student did not qualify for special education services.  This hearing was requested by the Board of Education on July 1, 2004 after the Student&#8482;s Mother, who was puzzled by the results of the testing, requested an independent 
evaluation.  A prehearing conference was convened on July 12, 2004 at which time a 
thirty day continuance was granted to allow the parties to pursue an advisory opinion; the hearing was scheduled for August 2, 2004.  The parties participated in the advisory 
opinion hearing process on July 26, 2004.  On July 27, 2004, the parties informed the 
hearing officer that the matter was in the process of being settled and requested that the 
August 2, 2004 hearing date be postponed.  The hearing was postponed and rescheduled 
for August 12, 2004.  The hearing convened on August 12, 2004 at which time the Board 
presented the testimony of Roberta Wezenski, the Board&#8482;s Director of Pupil Services; the 
Student&#8482;s Mother presented her own testimony on the Student&#8482;s behalf.
