The request was filed on June 25, 2001 and the date for the final decision, forty-five days henceforth, was August 9, 2001. The prehearing was held on June 29, 2001. The Hearing Officer, attorney for the Board and law clerk for the parents participated. The parties agreed to three hearing dates: August 9, August 16 and August 17. The parents&#8482; law clerk indicated that these were the first available dates for the attorney who would be appearing at hearing for the parents and that, in addition, he was on vacation for the last two weeks in August. On June 29, 2001 the law clerk representing the parents sent a letter to the Hearing Officer requesting a thirty day extension of the filing of the decision. On July 5, 2001 the Hearing Officer sent written notice of the three agreed upon dates to the parties and indicated in bold print that the granting of the extended dates was conditional upon the Hearing Officer receiving on or before July 9, 2001 an indication of whether the purpose of this continuance was for reason that the parties were engage in &#64257;good faith effort to complete negotiations.&#64258; No response was received to this inquiry.
