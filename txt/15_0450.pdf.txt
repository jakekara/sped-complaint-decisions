PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On April 9, 2015, the Newtown Board of Education received Parents’ request for a Special
Education Due Process Hearing. The undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on April 10,
2015. During the prehearing conference held on April 30, 2015, the hearing date of June 22,
2015 was set and the deadline for mailing the Final Decision and Order was established as June
23, 2015. Also during this preheating conference, the Parents requested an extension of the
deadline for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order in order to permit the palties to
participate in mediation and accommodate the agreed upon hearing date. This request was
granted and resulted in a new deadline of J u1y 23, 2015. On June 16, 2015, the parties jointly
requested that the ﬁrst scheduled hearing date of June 22, 2015 be postponed to allow for the
parties to engage in mediation on that date. After a consideration of all of the relevant factors,
this request was granted. Mediation was unsuccessful and a second preheating conference was
held on June 26, 2015. During this conference, hearing dates of August 24, 2015, September 11,
2015, September 15, 2015 and September 18, 2015 were scheduled. Also during this
conference, Parent indicated that Parents were in the process of retaining counsel. Parent was
informed that when counsel was retained, and their attorney requested a postponement of any of
the scheduled hearing dates, the request would be considered at the time it was ﬁ1ed. On July 13,
2015, Parents requested a thirty day extension of the deadline for the mailing of the Final
Decision and Order to accommodate the agreed upon hearing date schedule. After fully
considering the position of the parties and all of the relevant factors, Parents’ request was granted

and resulted in a new deadline of August 21, 2015. On August 4, 2015, Attorney Andrew
Feinstein ﬁled an appearance on behalf of the Parents. Attomey for the Parents requested an
extension of 30 days in order to accommodate the existing hearing date schedule. Attorney for
the Parents certiﬁed that granting of the extension would not cause educational or ﬁnancial harm
to either patty. The Board did not object to his request. After fully considering the position of
the parties and all of the relevant factors, Parents’ request was granted and resulted in a new
deadline of September 18, 2015. On August 18, 2015, Attorney for the Student requested a
postponement of the August 24, 2015 hearing date in order to have additional time to prepare for
the hearing given his recent appearance in the matter. The Board did not object to his request.
After a consideration of all of the relevant factors, this request was granted. On September 8,
2015, the Hearing Ofﬁcer cancelled the September 11, 2015 hearing date due to a death in her
family. On September 10, 2015, Attorney for the Parent requested postponement of the
September 15, 2015 hearing date, due to the illness of her client. This request was granted and
the hearing was set to go forward on September 18, 2015. On September 15, 2015, the Attorney
for the Parents withdrew their request for a Special Education Due Process Hearing with
prejudice.
