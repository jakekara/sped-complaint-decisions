 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  A special education hearing in the above-captioned matter was requested by the Student 
via Request for Impartial Special Education He
aring dated March 20, 2009. The request for due process hearing was received by the Due Process Unit on March 20, 2009. Pursuant to the Request for Hearing and Section 10-76h-10 of the Connecticut State Regulations, the matter was 
to proceed as an expedited hearing challenging a manifestation determination. Pursuant to the 
expedited hearing regulations, the hearing officer shall rule on the matter no more than 45 days 
after the Due Process Unit&#8482;s receipt of the Reque
st for Hearing. The deadline to rule on the matter in this case is May 4, 2009. 
A pre-hearing conference was held on April 6, 2009. Attorney Griff Trow appeared on behalf of the Student and Attorney Abby Wadler 
appeared on behalf of the Board of Education. At the pre-hearing conference, the parties agreed that, given the school vacation schedule, an attorney vacation schedule, and a jury trial schedule, an expedited request was not necessary given that the Board of Education will not proceed with an expulsion hearing prior to resolution of the issues raised in this case. The parties were given an opportunity to waive, in writing, the timelines for an expedited hearing reviewing a 
manifestation determination. The deadline to 
submit a written waiver was April 13, 2009. The hear
ing officer&#8482;s order indicated that, absent a 
written waiver by both parties, the expedited timelines would be followed.
