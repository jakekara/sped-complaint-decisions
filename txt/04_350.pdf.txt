 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  STATEMENT OF ISSUE  As provided in Paragraph 5 of the Settlement Agreement, what modifications, if 
any, are required to be made to the Board&#8482;s proposed program for the Student for 
the 2004/2005 school year in order for the Student to receive an appropriate education in the 2004/2005 school year in a Board classroom. 
 SUMMARY   For the 2004/2005 school year, the Parents placed the Student outside-of-the 

district at The Foundation School and commenced this action under the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C.&#167;&#167; 1401, et seq. (the &#64257;IDEA&#64258;) and Section 10-76 of the Connecticut General Statutes to obtain Board funding for that placement.  In February 

2004, the parties had resolved a dispute between them regarding the Student&#8482;s 
educational programming (the &#64257;Settlement Agreement&#64258;).  The Settlement Agreement 

defined the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the Student&#8482;s programming for both the 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 school years.  Both parties claim 
that the Settlement Agreement is in full force and effect and seek to have the Hearing 
Officer enforce the Settlement Agreement.  The Hearing Officer has determined: (1) that 
the Settlement Agreement is in force and is enforceable by its terms and in its entirety; 

(2) that pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement the only issue before the 
Hearing Officer with respect to the 2004/2005 school year is as stated in the preceding Section of this Final Decision and Order; and, (3) that to the extent the Parents are 
seeking funding from the Board for the Student&#8482;s placement at The Foundation School
