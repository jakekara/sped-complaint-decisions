Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The prehearing conference in this matter was conducted on September 9, 2004.  The 
original date for mailing of the final decision was October 15, 2004. Dates were agreed to 
by the parties and by agreement the forty-five days were extended.  At the first day of 
hearing on November 8, 2004, after some negotiation, the Student&#8482;s counsel requested a 
continuance so that evaluations could be completed.  The Board agreed to the evaluations 
but expressed concern about the delay this would cause to the due process hearing.  The 
hearing officer granted the continuance with the condition that the matter would be 
dismissed without prejudice if the matter did not go forward on January 4, 2005, which 
was the date the parties mutually agreed was realistic to complete the evaluations and 
proceed.  On December 6, 2004 by agreement of the parties the Hearing officer observed 
both the current placement and the proposed placement.  By letter dated December 27, 

2004 the Student&#8482;s counsel advised that the parties would need further time to pursue 
possible resolution of this matter through the PPT process and requested a continuance of 
the January 4, 2005 hearing, or a dismissal without prejudice if the continuance was not 

granted.  By letter dated December 29, 2004 the Board agreed to the continuance but 
continued to express concern about the &#64257;considerable delay&#64258; that had already occurred in this case.  The continuance was denied.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
