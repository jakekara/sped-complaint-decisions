FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Was the behavior of the Student, which led to an expulsion hearing, a
manifestation of his disability?

2. If so, is the Hartford Board of Education (“Board”) denying the Student a free and
appropriate public education (“FAPE”) by expelling the Student for that
behavior?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Guardian ﬁled for a due process hearing on October 15, 2013, following a
manifestation determination hearing held on September 19, 2013. An expedited hearing
was scheduled for November 4, 2013. A mandatory resolution meeting was to be held on
October 21, 2013. The Parents requested a rescheduling of the resolution meeting, which
was subsequently planned for October 25, 2013. The Board arrived on October 25, 2013
to convene the resolution meeting. The Guardian did not attend, but did have her
attorney and a staff person from the Department of Children and Families present, The
Board inquired as to if the Guardian was going to attend the mandatory resolution
meeting. The Board was informed that the Guardian would not be attending the meetng
either by phone or in person; therefore the resolution meeting did not go forward. The
Board ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss on October 28, 2013, copied to counsel for the Guardian,
On October 30, 2013, the Board notiﬁed the Hearing Ofﬁcer via email, and copied to
counsel for the Guardian, that the Board had learned that the Student was no longer
enrolled in the Hartford Public Schools. The Board stated that as long as the Student was
not enrolled in the Haﬁford Public Schools it would no longer be seeking expulsion of
the Student, and requested that the matter be dismissed as moot. There has been no

response to either the Motion to Dismiss 01‘ the information indicating that the Student is
no longer enrolled in the Hartford Public Schools by the Guardian.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

Relevant to an expedited hearing request and pursuant to 34 Code ot‘Federal Regulations
(“C.F.R.”) §300.532(c)(3)(i) “a resolution meeting must occur within seven days of
receiving notice of the due process complaint. . .”), a time frame that the Parties cannot
mutually agree to extend. 1d The Board properly scheduled a resolution meeting within
the seven day time period, to which the Guardian requested a rescheduling of the meeting
to a time period that was outside of the mandatory seven day time period. The Parties did
not waive the resolution period in lieu of the use of mediation, as described in 34 CPR.
§300.506. The Board accommodated the Guardian and rescheduled the resolution
meeting to a time period that was still within the 20 calendar day time period for
resolving the matter. The Guardian did not attend the rescheduled resolution meeting
held on October 25, 2013. Given that the Guardian has failed to attend the mandatory
resolution meeting and has disenrolled the Student from the Hartford Public School
System and enrolled him in another school system, and with the Board stating it no
longer is seeking expulsion of the Student as long as he is not in the Board’s system,
there remains nothing in dispute in this matter. The matter is therefore DISMISSED with

prejudice
