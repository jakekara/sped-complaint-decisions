  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  
ISSUES:  
1. Has the Board provided all of the Student&#8482;s records, including those transferred from Hartford, to 
the Parent in a timely fashion? 
 
2. Was the decision of the manifestation dete
rmination held on Oc
tober 8, 2008, correct? 
 
3. Has the Board provided an appropriate program 
of homebound instruction in a timely fashion 
during the Student&#8482;s exclusion from school? 
 
4. Are the IEP and Placement proposed by the Bo
ard at the October 22, 2008, PPT meeting 
appropriate to the Student&#8482;s special education needs in the least restrictive environment? 
 
5. Is the Student entitled to compensatory educational services? 
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
   This hearing was requested November 24, 2008,
 and the Hearing Officer was appointed on November 25, 2008.  The date for mailing the fina
l decision was January 7, 2009.  A pre-hearing 
conference was held on December 3, 2008.  At that 
time, the Hearing Officer
 perceived that the 
hearing involved both an appeal of a manifesta
tion decision concerning a disciplinary matter and the 
question of an appropriate Individualized Education Program (IEP) and placement for the Student.
