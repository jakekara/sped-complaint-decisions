July 29, 2015 Final Decision and Order 15-0486

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as Other Health Impaired and is entitled to receive FAPE as
deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C.
§1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement
team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2014-2015
school year. The Parents requested placement at Sandhill Child Development Center. The Board
refused the Parents’ request.

On April 30, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The parties
agreed to a resolution session. The resolution session date was pending. An impartial hearing
ofﬁcer was appointed on May 5, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was held on May 11, 2015.
A hearing date of June 26, 2015 was chosen by the parties.

In an electronic transmission dated June 8, 2015, the parties advised the hearing ofﬁcer that they
were able to resolve the matter in the resolution session, but needed additional time to ﬁnalize

the agreement. They requested that the June 26, 2015 hearing date be cancelled. Their request
was granted. A July 15, 2015 hearing date was scheduled.

On July 14, 2015, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that they were in the process
of ratifying the agreement and withdrew the matter without prejudice. The Ju1y 15, 2015 hearing
date was cancelled.

The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is August 13, 2015.
