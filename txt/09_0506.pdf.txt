 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  This matter was commenced by request for due pr
ocess dated June 4, 2009, subsequently revised on June 11, 2009 to include a request for attorney&#8482;s fees as 
part of the relief sought.  The Board states that it received the revised request on June 16, 2009.  The June 4, 2009 and June 11, 2009 submissions are 
referred to collectively herein as the &#64257;Request.&#64258;  The undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer on June 22, 2009.    
The Student is a rising 11th grader attending the Board&#8482;s publi
c schools.  There is no reported 
dispute as to her eligibility for sp
ecial education and related services under the IDEIA, or as to her eligibility classification which is specific learning disa
bility (&#64257;SLD&#64258;).  The Request alleges that the Student has been denied a FAPE since 2003 and seeks, among other things, an order for compensatory reading services consistent with the Parent&#8482;s request at 
an IEP meeting on December 8, 2008 as a remedy for that 
alleged denial of FAPE, and an order directing that for the 2009/2010 school year the District implement an 
IEP reflecting the recommendations st
ated in an independent educational evaluation (&#64257;IEE&#64258;) presented to and considered by the IEP team at a meeting on Apr
il 28, 2009.   The Board did not file a sufficiency challenge or an answer. 
 
By agreement of the parties, 
a telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) convened on July 2, 2009.  Each party participated through counsel, the Parent through Ms. Cochrane and the Board through Ms. Kaufmann.  Counsel reported at the PHC that a re
solution meeting had not ye
t convened.  Both parties expressed a desire to convene a resolution session and a willingness to explore resolving their dispute through a Connecticut Department of Education 
(&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;)-facilitated medi
ation.  Ms. Cochrane
