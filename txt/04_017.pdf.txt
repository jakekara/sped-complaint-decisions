proposing that the Student be moved from the current placement and program at ACES to 
a placement and program within the school district?  
  PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  This hearing was requested on January 22, 2004.  A prehearing conference was convened on January 29, 2004 at which time a hearing date was scheduled for March 8, 2004.  The 
Parents moved to consolidate this hearing with the hearings of two other unrelated 
children within the same school district; this motion was denied.  Hearing dates were 

then also set for April 13 and May 3, 2004.  The hearing convened on March 8, 2004 at which time the parties requested an extension pending the report of an independent 
consultant.  The April 13 and May 3, 2004 hearing dates were postponed and a hearing 
date was set for May 27, 2004; the date for the mailing of the final decision and order 
was extended to June 14, 2004.  Beginning on May 10, 2004, the parties began exchanging letters with regard to whether the issues as they related to the 2003-2004 
school year were moot and/or included the 2004-2005 school year.  On May 25, 2004, 
the hearing officer and the parties&#8482; attorneys participated in a telephone conference to discuss these issues.
