       Hearing Officer 
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUES:  1. Is the placement proposed by the Board, at Cook Hill School, appropriate to Student&#8482;s 
special education needs in the least restrictive environment? 
 2. If not, should Student remain in her current placement at ACES Village School? 
  PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  This hearing was requested by a letter dated November 12, 2003, from Student&#8482;s Parent.  

A Hearing Officer was appointed at that time. 
 Subsequently, Parent retained an attorney and notified the Due Process Unit of her representation by letter dated November 25, 
2003.  The original Hearing Officer recused herself on January 19, 2004, and the current Hearing Officer was appointed on January 20, 2004.  On January 28, 2004, the Parent&#8482;s Attorney filed a motion to consolidate this case with 
two other special education hearings, on the basis that all three cases involved students from the Board&#8482;s district who were atte
nding a program at ACES, and for whom a 
program within the Board&#8482;s school had been proposed.
