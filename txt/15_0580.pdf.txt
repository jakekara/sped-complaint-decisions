On September 24, 2015, the Student requested an additional extension of the deadline to ﬁle
the ﬁnal decision so that the parties could complete their settlement agreement. That request
was also granted, and the deadline to ﬁle the ﬁnal decision was extended to October 23, 2015.

On October 23, 2015, the Student requested an additional extension of the deadline to ﬁle the
ﬁnal decision so that the parties could complete their settlement agreement. That request was
also granted, and the deadline to ﬁle the ﬁnal decision was extended to November 6, 2015.

On November 3, 2015, the Hearing Ofﬁcer requested a status report on the parties’ settlement
and warned that the deadline to ﬁle the ﬁnal decision was again approaching. The Hearing
Ofﬁcer warned that, in the absence of another request for extension of the deadline to ﬁle the
ﬁnal decision, the matter would be dismissed for failure to prosecute. Neither party
responded.

The Student has failed to prosecute this matter.
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

due process.
