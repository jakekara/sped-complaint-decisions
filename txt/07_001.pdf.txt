the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (the &#64257;IDE
IA&#64258;), and its implementing regulations, 34 
C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 300.1 &#338; 300.754 (the &#64257;IDEIA Regulations&#64258;), and pursuant to Connecticut&#8482;s special education laws, Conn. Gen. Stat. &#167;&#167; 10-76a, et seq. and their related regulations, Reg. Conn. State Agencies &#167;&#167; 10-76a-1 et seq..

 ISSUES SET FOR HEARING
  1. Whether the educational program and 
placement developed by the District at 
the December 14, 2006 PPT, as modified at 
the March 19, 2007 PPT (the &#64257;District 
Recommended IEP&#64258;), is reasonably calculated 
to provide the Student with a FAPE in the 
LRE? 
 2. If the District Recommended IEP is not
 reasonably calculated to provide the 
Student with a FAPE in the LRE, is an out-of-
district placement in a 
therapeutic day program 
required to provide the Student with a FAPE in the LRE at this time?   
 3. If the District Recommended IEP is no
t reasonably calcula
ted to provide the Student with a FAPE in the LRE and an out-of-district placement in a therapeutic day 
program is not required to provi
de the Student with a FAPE in the LRE, what modifications, 
if any, must be made to the District Recommended IEP to provide the Student with a FAPE 

in the LRE in an in-district placement in
 the District&#8482;s Autism Program (&#64257;AP&#64258;)?
