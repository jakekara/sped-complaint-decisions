FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Whether the Board denied the Student a free appropriate public education [FAPE] for the 2010-1 1,
2011-12 and 2012—13 school years, including related services and ESY, because the programs and
services were not intensive, individualized 01‘ sufﬁcient to allow him to make meaningful

educational progress academically, socially and functionally;
2. Whether the Student shall be placed at BenHaven immediately as requested by the Parents;

3, Whether the Student is entitled to compensatory education.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:

This request for hearing was received by the Board on November 19, 2012 and a preheating conference
convened on November 30, 2012. The patties agreed to submit the case for mediation, and requested an
extension of the mailing date of the decision to allow for the scheduling of the mediation.

The hearing convened on February 13, 2013 although the schools were closed due to the cleanup
necessitated by a massive snowstorm. Due to the schedu1ing complications caused by the snowstorm
issues and due to other scheduling complications, both counsel requested that they proceed with a
mediation on the hearing date, rather than with testimony. That request was granted on the record at the

hearing, prior to proceeding with testimony in the case.

The mailing date of the decision was extended and the matter was scheduled to continue on March 15,
2013. On March 4, 2013 a request was received from the Parents’ attorney that the Parents withdraw their
request for hearing, without prejudice, as the palties were in the process of scheduling a PPT to review
recent triennial testing. Therefore, this matter is dismissed.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED.
