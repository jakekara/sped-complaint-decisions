Spak Hearing Officer FINAL DECISION AND ORDER ISSUE: 1.Whether the assistive technology evaluation already conducted was an independent evaluation and appropriate for the Student, and, if not, should another assistive technology evaluation be conducted at Board expense, and, if so, who should conduct said evaluation. SUMMARY: Another special education due process matter is being conducted involving the same 
parties (Case No. 02-295). While this other due process hearing was in progress, the parents requested an independent assistive technology evaluation of the Student. The Board maintained that such an evaluation had already been conducted and filed for due process through the instant case, No. 02-359. The parents then indicated they were withdrawing their request for an independent assistive technology evaluation of the Student in the other matter. The Board indicated that this being the case, the Board no longer had need to pursue this instant hearing. The parties agreed this matter (Case No. 02-359) could be dismissed.
