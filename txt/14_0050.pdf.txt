prehearing conference took place on September 13, 2013, during which there was discussion ot‘pending
evaluations that both patties felt would contain information critical to the hearing.

On September 16, 2013, the paﬁies jointly requested that the hearing dates scheduled for September and
October be postponed in order to allow time for the completion of the pending independent educational
evaluations. The paltics also requested an extension of the deadline for the mailing of the ﬁnal decision
and order. The Attorney for the Parent indicated in her request for postponement that the Student would
not experience any harm as a result of the postponement of the scheduled dates. After considering all of
the applicable factors, the request for postponement was granted and all dates in September and October
were postponed and new hearing dates of November 7, 2013 and November 12, 2013 were set. A new
deadline for the mailing of the ﬁnal decision and order was established as November 30, 2013. On

occur. The hearing was suspended with instruction to parties that if the hearing request was not
withdrawn by 9:00 am. November 18, 2013 the hearing would go forward on November 19, 2013. On
