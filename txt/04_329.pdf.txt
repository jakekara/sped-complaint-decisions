West Hartford Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parents:  Mother, pro se  Appearing on behalf of the Board:  Attorney Susan C. Freedman Shipman & Goodwin LLP One Constitution Plaza Hartford, CT  06103-1919     Appearing before:    Attorney Patricia M. Strong Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   PROCEDURAL HISTORY   The Parent requested this hearing on October 8, 2004 via a faxed letter from the Mother.  This hearing officer was assigned to the case on that date.  A prehearing conference was held on October 25.  The parties requested a 30-day extension of the decision deadline in order to proceed with mediation.  The request was granted and the hearing was scheduled for November 30.  Following the issuance of the hearing notice, the Parent wrote to the Hearing Officer stating that she was "counter requesting to rescind this extension."  She stated that she had filed a request for an expedited due process hearing and wanted this Hearing Officer to add disciplinary matters to the issues in the above case.  The Hearing Officer wrote to the Parties on October 26 stating that the expedited issues would be joined to the pending case only if the Parent agreed to have the expedited hearing issues mediated with the other issues and, if mediation failed, to proceed with the hearing on November 30.  Otherwise, the Hearing Officer refused to accept the addition of the expedited hearing issues.  No response was received to this letter.    On November 18, the Parent wrote to the Hearing Officer advising that the parties mediated the case on November 15 and requesting permission to withdraw the case without prejudice.  She did not say whether the case had been settled or resolved.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The Parent's request to withdraw the hearing is granted.  It is ordered that the case be dismissed without prejudice.
