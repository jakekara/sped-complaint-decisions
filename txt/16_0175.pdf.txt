F INAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Was the District’s proposed program for the 2015—2016 school year designed to provide Student
with a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)?

2. If the District’s proposed program for the 2015-2016 year was not designed to provide Student
with a FAPE, does Eagle Hill — Southport provide Student with an appropriate program, thereby
entitling Parents to reimbursement for costs resulting from their unilateral placement of Student
at that school?

a prior Neuropsychological Evaluation?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On October 1, 2015, the Board received a Special Education Due Process Hearing Request ﬁled by

15, 2015. The parties further indicated that they had agreed to engage in mediation with a scheduled
mediation date of December 21, 2015. A joint request for extension of the mailing deadline was made
during the prehearing conference in order to allow the parties to engage in mediation. This request was
granted and resulted in a new mailing deadline of J anuary 14, 2016. On December 29, 2015, Attomey
for the Student requested an extension 01‘ the mailing deadline to accommodate the agreed upon hearing
date schedule. There was no objection from the Board to this request. The request was granted and a

Student sent an email to the Hearing Ofﬁcer indicating that the Parents were withdrawing their hearing
