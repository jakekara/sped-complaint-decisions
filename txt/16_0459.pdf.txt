in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and
Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the

Board place the Student at CREC, Polaris 01' ACES for the 2015—201 6 School year at public expense.
The Board refused the Parent’s request and the Parent ﬁled for due process, notice of which was
received by the Board on April 8, 2016. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on April 12, 2016
and a pre-hearing conference was held on April 19, 2016. The Parents agreed to waive a resolution
meeting and proceed to mediation. In an electronic transmission, the Parent’s attorney advised the
hearing ofﬁcer that the panties were able to resolve the issues and requested that the matter be withdrawn
with prejudice. There was no objection by the Board. The withdrawal was granted. The mailing date of
the Final Decision and Order is June 22, 2016.
