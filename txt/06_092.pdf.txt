Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The prehearing in this matter was conducted on April 13, 2006.  Both parties participated 
and hearing dates that were agreed to were selected.  The issues in dispute were failure to change the student&#8482;s IEP, failure to increase the amount of instruction, failure to 
reconsider a manifestation determination from four months earlier and compensatory 

education.  The date for mailing of the final decision was set by agreement at June 25, 

2006.  Prior to the first day of hearing the parties reported they were working toward a 
settlement and requested that the first day be cancelled.  At the second date of hearing the 

parties reported they had reached an agreement but needed time to finalize it and 

requested the existing hearing dates remain scheduled.  This was granted and prior to the 

third scheduled hearing date the Student&#8482;s counsel reported that the matter had been 

resolved and requested that it be dismissed with prejudice.   
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The hearing is dismissed with prejudice.
