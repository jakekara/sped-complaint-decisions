FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Is the program provided by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year appropriate and does it provide
a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE)? If not;

2. Does the Student require placement at Woodhouse Academy for the 2015-2016 school year in order
to receive FAPE in the LRE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Emotional Disturbance and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned
in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and
Connecticut General Statutes §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the
Parent rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year and requested
placement at Woodhouse Academy for the 2015-2016 school year. The Board refused the Parent’s
request. The Parent ﬁled for due process.

On J uly 22, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request for due process. The father is not
the custodial Parent or legal guardian of the Student. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on
July 22, 2015 and a pre—hearing conference was held on August 7, 2015. At the pre-hearing
conference, the Board gave notice that they were going to ﬁle a Motion to Dismiss and requested a
brieﬁng schedule; the parties agreed to a schedule. On August 13, 2015, the Board ﬁled a timely
Motion to Dismiss with accompanying Memorandum of Law. The Parent’s attorney requested an
extension to respond to the Board’s motion. The Board did not object to the extension. The response
to the motion was extended to August 26, 2015.

In an electronic transmission dated August 25, 2015, the Parent’s attorney informed the hearing ofﬁcer
that the matter was withdrawn. The mailing date of the Final Decision and Order is October 5, 2015.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISSMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer Within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescﬁption of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either palty in accordance with the provisions of Section 4—183, Connecticut
General Stamtes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
