At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parent rej ected the program offered by the Board
for the 2015-2016 school year. The Parent requested placement at Options Employment and Educational
Services for the 2015-2016 school year. The Board refused the Parent’s request and the Parent ﬁled for
due process.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on July 20, 2015 and a pre—hearing conference was held on
July 28, 2015. The hearing dates chosen by the parties were October 1, November 2, 10, 24, December
3, 2015, January 7,11,13 and 19, 2016. The December 3, 2015 and January11,13 and 19, 2016 hearing
dates were cancelled.

At the January 7, 2016 hearing date, the parties requested time to see if they could resolve the matter.
After conferring the palties advised the hearing ofﬁcer that an agreement had been reached, but they

The date for the mailing of the F inal Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the parties’
mediation and the hearing dates. The mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is J anuary 23, 2016.
