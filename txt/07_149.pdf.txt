 PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
 The Parents filed a due process hearing request with the State Department of Education 
(SDE) and the Norwalk Board of Education on June 1, 2007.  This Hearing Officer was 
assigned to the case on June 5.  A prehearing conference was held on June 21.  At the prehearing conference the parties agreed to mediate and hear
ing dates were scheduled for July 18, 19 and 25.  The decision deadline was set at August 14.  On July 10 the Hearing 
Officer was notified that mediation was sche
duled for July 18.  The Parents&#8482; attorney requested a postponement of the July 18 
hearing, which was granted.  The hearing convened on July 19.  Parent Exhibits P-1 through P-149 and Board Exhibits B-1 through B-127 were entered as full exhibits.  Following the Parents&#8482; opening statement, the 

Parents presented testimony from Eileen Luddy, Ph.D., who testified on direct examination for the remainder of the day.  He

 no agreement, the Parents&#8482; attorney would 
file a motion for an interim order.  On July
