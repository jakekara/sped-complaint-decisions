September 24, 2015 Final Decision and Order 15-0523

August 6, 2015 were set. Via email dated June 29, 2015, Attorney for the Student requested a
thirty day extension of the deadline for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order in order to
accommodate the agreed upon hearing date schedule. Attorney for the Board had no objection to
this request. The extension request was granted and resulted in a revised deadline of August 28,
2015. On July 31, 2015, both scheduled hearing dates were postponed at the request of Attorney
for the Student so that both parties could participate in a Flaming and Placement Team meeting
to discuss new services being offered by the District which could impact Student’s program. On
August 4, 2015, a second prehearing conference was held and new hearing dates of October 23,
2015, October 30, 2015, November 2, 2015, November 4, 2015, November 12, 2015, and
November 13, 2015 were set. On August 20, 2015, Attorney for the Student made a second
request to extend the deadline for mailing the Final Decision and Order. The stated purpose of
this extension request was to permit the parties to reduce a settlement agreement to a writing.
This request was granted and resulted in a new deadline of September 25, 2015. On September 9,
2015, Attorney sent an email to the Hearing Ofﬁcer in which she withdrew Parents’ Special
Education Due Process Hearing Request with prejudice.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
