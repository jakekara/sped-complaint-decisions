ence was held with the Board&#8482;s attorney and the Parent (Father). He insisted that he had canceled th
e case and despite a detailed explanation that the Board 
was the only party that could withdraw the case since it filed the case, the Parent refused to speak to anyone except the Special Education Supervisor

other to see if the case could be settled.  No hearing date was scheduled, but the mailing date for the final 
decision was set at August 6, 2010. La
ter in the day on July 7, 2010, the Board&#8482;s attorney advised the Hearing Officer that the Parents had withdrawn their request
 for an independent evaluation and the Board was 
withdrawing its hearing request without prejudice.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
