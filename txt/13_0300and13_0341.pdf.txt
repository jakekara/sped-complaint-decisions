7. Shall the Board of Education be permitted to conduct a psychiatric evaluation of Student in

the absence of parental consent?

On March 21, Student’s Attorney ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss Case 13-0341 0n the basis that there
is no basis under the IDEA for BOE to obtain an updated psychiatric evaluation without parental consent
and, in the alternative, that BOE forfeited any right to further evaluation of Student,

At the March 22 hearing, Student’s Attorney ﬁled a written withdrawal of issues two and three
The request was granted on the record. Upon review, it was determined that the statement 01‘ issues that
Student’s Attorney sought to withdraw were issues identiﬁed in another case before this Hearing Ofﬁcer
and not any ot‘the issues identiﬁed in this case. Student’s Attorney subsequently sought to withdraw the
request for withdrawal. The request to withdraw issues two and three was denied.

On March 28, BOE’s Attorney ﬁled a timely objection to the Motion to Dismiss. Aﬁer fully
considering the positions of the parties, the Motion to Dismiss was denied on the basis that the request
for due process states a claim upon which relief can be granted.

Hearings were held on April 3 and April 9. At the April 9 hearing, after discussion about hearing
dates, Student’s Attorney made a verbal request on the record for an extension of the deadline to mail

for an extension but reiterated Student’s Parents desire to not delay and to have a decision soon. After
fully considering the positions of the palties, the request was granted on the record and the deadline to

Findings of Relevant Fact

1.

3

Student has attended BOE’s schools from kinderganen through palt of tenth grade. The majority 01‘
her grades were in the A range (Stip FOF 3). 3 She received positive remarks from her teachers, had
good attendance, and demonstrated an interest in school (P-1, P—2, P—3, P-4, P—5, P—6, P—7; Testimony
of Student’s Mother).

Student is described by her mother and BOE staff as being a quiet child.

In late fall 2010 (during her freshman year), Student began engaging in self—injurious behaviors such
as cutting (P—8, P—33; Testimony of Student’s Mother). Neither Student’s Parents nor BOE staff were
aware of Student’s behaviors at that time (Testimony of Mother).

In April 201 1, Student had suicidal ideations and took an overdose of pills (P—33; Testimony of
Student’s Mother).

Via e-mail dated April 26, 2011, Student’s Mother notiﬁed Student’s teachers and Guidance
Counselor that Student had been diagnosed With Major Depression and that she had been
“profoundly unhappy for some time (which comes as something of shock to me)” Student’s Mother
asked to be notiﬁed if the teachers notice anything “off" with Student. (B—23, B—24, B-25, B—26, B—
27, 8—28; Testimony of Student’s Mother),

Student’s Mother did not notify BOE that Student wasiseeing a therapist at that time (Testimony of
Student’s Mother).

In May, 2011, Student was taken to the emergency room due to her self-injurious behaviors as
discovered by her parents. Student was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disordein Student was
hospitalized from May 25 to June 22, 2011 at Psychiatric Hospital (Stip FOF 4; P-S, P46;
Testimony 01‘ Student’s Mother).

came as a shock to them at the time.

Student’s Mother notiﬁed BOE and Guidance Counselor notiﬁed Student’s teachers that Student
would not return to High School for the remainder of the year and that the teachers needed to

provide all the materials that Student would need to complete her course requirements and make a

plan for her to access her ﬁnal exams (B-29). Student’s teachers worked with Student’s Mother to
provide her school assignments while in the hospital (P—75).
Student was absent from school approximately 27 days during fourth quarter of the 2010—1 1 school
year due to her hospitalization and in—patient program (B-31, B—34). Her founh quarter grades
ranged from B+ t0 A+, which was consistent with her ﬁrst through third quarter grades (B—31). Her
ﬁnal exams were waived after her teachers determined that her grades and performance
demonstrated that she had mastered the curriculum requirements (B—32, P—75; Testimony of
Guidance Counselor). Student’s Mother was notified and indicated that it would be a “great relief”
to Student (B-32, B—33, P—75). . :
Student started her sophomore year at BOE’s High School and participated in the Learning
Independence through Future Experience (“LIFE”) program (Stip FOF 5).
Student did not participate in the Human Relations course in the LIFE room because it conﬂicted
with an honors level course that she wanted to take. Student’s Parents wanted her to remain in
honors level courses. They did not have concerns about Student’s academic abilities (Testimony of
Student’s Mother).
Via e-mail dated September 12, 201 1, Guidance Counselor asked to meet with Student’s Parents to
discuss a 504 plan to give Student some accommodations (B—35).
A 504 meeting was held on September 27, 201 1 (Stip FOF 6; P-17, P-75). The 504 team determined
that Student’s mental impairment substantially limited her major life activity of learning due to
concentration and attention issues (Stip FOF 6; B-38). Several accommodations were made,
including extended time on assignments and tests, pattieipation in the LIFE Program, and periodic
check in with Guidance Counselor (P—75; Testimony of Student’s Mother).
The LIFE Program is “an individualized suppon system designed to meet the unique needs of
students who may be transitioning back to the high school from hospitalization, residential
placement, or intensive day treatment programs. . .”(P-18).
Student spent time in the LIFE room and sought out Social Worker on occasion (P-75). When
Student spent a class session in the LIFE room instead of her regularly assigned classroom, an
absence would be reﬂected on her record for that class.
Student found the content ofa required reading book to be triggering. She was provided an
accommodation to allow her to view two movies and write a report as an alternative (Testimony of

Student’s Mother, Guidance Counselor). Such alternative assignments are not uncommon for
students.

Guidance Counselor notiﬁed Student’s teacher that she did not feel comfortable standing in front of
a class doing a skit. Student had an opportunity to practice in the LIF E room to prepare.

Student’s self—injurious behavior resumed in fall 2011 (P—33, P-59; Testimony of Student’s Mother).
She engaged in cutting, burning, and “practicing” hanging herself (P—33).

1n fall 2011, Student began pulling out her hair. Over the winter holiday break, Student increased
her self—injurious behavior (P—59; Testimony of Student’s Mother).

On January 9, 2012, Student was admitted to Psychiatric Hospital as a result of reoccun‘ences 0f
self—inj urious behavior (Stip FOF 7; P-21; Testimony of Student’s Mother). She was cleared for
discharge on January 20, 2012 and was recommended for residential placement (Stip FOF 7; B—46;
Testimony of Student’s Mother).

On January 14, 2012, Student’s Parents informed staff at High School that they were attempting to
transfer Student from Psychiatric Hospital to Private Residential Program which has a Private
Special Education School (Stip FOF 8).

Student’s Mother notiﬁed Guidance Counselor that Student was in “terrible shape” and not likely
able to return to High School. Guidance Counselor responded that she would set up a Planning and
Placement T eam (“PPT”) (B-41, P-75). Student’s Step-Father notiﬁed Superintendent that Student
was suffering from severe psychological issues and could not be left unsupervised. He inquired as to
what role BOE would play when Student was admitted to a residential program (B-42).

On January 20, 2012, Student’s treatment providers at Psychiatric Hospital wrote a letter stating “(i)t
is the treatment team’s clinical recommendation that [Student] attend [Private] residential treatment
program at this time in order to meet her educational, social and emotional needs.” (Stip FOF 9).
On January 20, 2012, Student was discharged from Psychiatric Hospital and was placed by her
parents at Private Residential Program (P—23; Testimony of Student’s Mother).

On January 20, 2012, BOE made a referral to determine il‘Student was eligible for special education
(Stip FOF 10).

On January 23, 2012, Student entered the Private Residential Program’s residential therapeutic

program, where she still resides (Stip FOF 1 1, Stip FOF 18). Private Special Education School is an

approved private special education program of the Connecticut State Department of Education (Stip
FOF 12).

A duly noticed PPT meeting was held on January 30, 2012 to review Guidance Counselor’s referral
of Student for consideration of eligibility for special education (Stip FOF 12; B—44, B-45, B—47, B-
57, P—26). Student’s Parents attended the PPT meeting.

The PPT meeting notes indicate Student had been hospitalized twice within the last year, was
identiﬁed as having depression, and had been receiving sewices through a 504 plan.

The PPT recommended a psychiatric evaluation and edycational/achievement review (Stip FOF 12;
B-57). Student’s Parents provided consent for the evaluation and signed releases to allow Dr.
Aversa, the evaluator, to obtain information (Stip FOF l2; B—58; Testimony of Student’s Mother).
BOE refused Student’s Parent’s request for reimbursement for the privately placed program (Stip
FOF 12).

Prior to January 2012, Student was performing well academically, received A’s and B’s, and was
enrolled in honors courses (13-57).

In March 2012, Student took the Connecticut Academic Performance Test (“CAPT”). She scored in
the goal or advanced range on all subjects (B—60).

On March 15, 2013, Dr. Aversa interviewed Student at her private placement. Dr. Aversa noted in
his repoﬂ that Student “is a sophomore at [High School] but has had signiﬁcant difﬁculties over the
past two years including depression, suicide attempts and signiﬁcant self injurious behavior.” (Stip
FOF 13).

On March 23, 2012, BOE’s Special Education Directoy completed an educational review of Student
(B-64, P—37). The review noted Student’s high performance at BOE’s schools from kindergarten
through midyear of tenth grade when she was privately placed and at Private Special Education
School (B—64). Special Education Director noted that Student continued to perform successfully
within BOE’s High School despite her absence in ninth grade. The educational review also cited her
attendance history and performance on standardized tests.

Student’s March 30, 2012 academic progress report for Private Special Education School reﬂects
grades ranging from 90 to 100 and teacher comments indicate “outstanding academic progress,”

“outstanding effott,” and other positive comments (B-65, P—34).

Dr. Aversa completed a psychiatric evaluation of Student and issued his repon in April 2012 (B-62,
P-42).

Dr. Aversa made educational recommendations that included consider small class size, ﬂexibility in
class periods, a “go to” person with whom she can check in, ability to “take space”, reduced
workload for a time period while psychiatric issues are being addressed, oppOItunities for
socialization, on-going assessment and adjustment of school plan, and consideration of additional
psychological and educational testing (B—62).

Dr. Aversa also made non-educational reconmnendations regarding therapeutic sewices and
psychophal‘macologic management (B—62).

A duly noticed PPT meeting was held on April 9, 2012 to review Studenﬁs psychiatric evaluation
and educational review and to determine Student’s eligibility for special education (Stip FOF 14; B—
66, P-40).

At the PPT meeting, the team determined Student was eligible for special education under the Other
Health Impairment (“01-11”) category and changed Student’s placement from BOE’s High School to
the therapeutic day program at Private Special Education School (Stip FOF 14; B—70). The PPT
recommended 25.5 hours of academic sewice and 30 minutes of counseling per week. BOE assumed
the cost of the therapeutic educational day program retroactive to the date of placement (Stip FOF
14; B—70; Testimony of Student’s Mother).

Student’s Parents expressed disagreement with the CHI category and expressed that they thought
Serious Emotional Disturbance (“SED”) was a better categoxy (Stip FOF 14; Testimony of Student’s
Mother). The PPT determined that Student did not qualify for special education on the basis of SBD
because the impact on her educational performance was limited (Stip FOF 14).

Following the PPT, Student’s Mother provided suggested edits to Dr. Aversa’s report (B-69;
Testimony of Student’s Mother). Thofée edits were not made by Dr. Aversa (Testimony of Student’s
Mother).

Beginning in spring 2012, Student began weekend home visits under close parental supervision (P—
47, P—60; Testimony of Student’s Mother).

In May 2012, Private Residential Program’s Director oi’Psychiati'y opined that Student requires

continued residential treatment given the magnitude of her symptoms and tenuous nature of her

improvement; that Student needs supervision at all times; and that, absent such supervision, she is at
risk for serious injury or death (P-49).

A duly noticed PPT meeting was held on May 21, 2012 to conduct an annual review, review or
revise the IEP, and consider transition needs (Stip FOF 15; B-68, B-73). A transition goal was
added to her IEP and counseling services were increased (B—73, P—52).

The present levels of performance portion of the IEP states “Student’s current psychiatric state is
affecting her ability to fully access her academics. Student requires signiﬁcant amount (sic) of
structure and suppoﬁ in order to provide for her emotional needs.” Small group/individual
instruction was recommended for 27.75 hours per week. Counseling in a small group was
recommended for one hour per day and individual counseling instiuction was recommended 1.5
hours per week. The PPT recommended that BOE fund the educational portion of the placement at
Private Special Education School for the 2012—13 school year (Stip FOF 15).

Student’s June 15, 2012 academic progress repolt for Private Special Education School reﬂects ﬁnal
grades ranging from 92 to 100 and teacher comments again indicated “outstanding academic
progress”, “outstanding effoﬂ” and other positive comments (B-76, P-55).

Student’s home passes were suspended in summer 2012 due to an incident involving alcohol and
prescription drugs (P-62; Testimony of Student’s Mother). Home passes were reinstated in October
2012 (P-62).

In October 2012, Student’s Parents retained Dr. Eric Frazer to conduct a psychological evaluation
(B—Sl; Testimony of Student’s Mother).

Dr. F razer noted in his summary of evaluation results that “there has been a gradual decline over the
past several years in Student’s ﬁanctioning, with symptomatic features ol‘depl’ession, hair pulling,
pathological food control and body image distoﬂions, environmental inﬂuences, and
decompensation brought on by deliberate acts of self—injury and suicide attempts.” He noted that
while paltia] stabilization has occurred, “acute concerns have persisted speciﬁcally including
symptoms of her Eating Disorder, self—harm behaviors while on passes, hair pulling, and complex
identity difﬁculties.” He ﬁnther noted “(t)he intense and chronic nature of her problems lends
explanation to the signiﬁcant therapeutic challenges that will take signiﬁcant time for Student to

incorporate practically and internally. As it peitains to her education, Dr. Frazer stated that “the

overall clinical data is clear that she requires this level of intense residential care to paiticipate in her
schoolwork and education constmctively on a daily basis.” (Stip FOF 16).

Dr. Frazer testiﬁed that Student integrated well and was successful academically at Private Special
Education School.

Private Special Education School Therapist testiﬁed that Student is highly intelligent and a highly
motivated student who does quite well academically.

Student refrained from self-injurious behavior from January 8, 2012 until fall 2012 (P-60; Testimony
of Student’s Mother).

BOE worked with Student’s Parents to provide more challenging academic coursework, including
honors and AP classes (B-78, P—75).

Student’s November 2, 2012 academic progress report for Private Special Education School reﬂects
ﬁnal grades ranging from 95 to 100 and teacher comments again indicated “outstanding academic
progress”, “outstanding effort” and other positive comments (B—76, P—64).

A duly noticed PPT meeting was held on November 26, 2012 to discuss Dr. Frazer’s report and
Student’s Mother’s October 17, 2012 request that BOE pay for Student’s residential program (Stip
FOF 17; B—80, B—83, P-68, P-85, P—86). At that meeting, BOE refused to fund the residential poﬂion
0f Student’s placement, maintained her designation as OHI, and recommended an updated
psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Avel'sa.

The PPT refused payment for the residential portion of Student’s program at Private Residential
Program but continued to fund Student’s continued placement at Private Special Education School
for the 2012—13 school year as an accommodation to the family (Stip FOF 17). The IEP reﬂects ﬁve
hours per week of group counseling, and 1.5 hours per week of individual counseling, as well as
27.75 hours per week of special education instnlction in small group or individual settings (Stip FOF
17).

Student’s Parents submitted an Addendum to the November 26, 2012 PPT meeting summa1y and
asked that it be distributed to all members of the PPT (P—88; Testimony of Student‘s Mother).
Student’s January 18, 2013 academic progress repoﬂ for Private Special Education School reﬂects
ﬁnal grades ranging from 95 to 100 and teacher comments again indicated “outstanding academic
progress”, “outstanding effort” and other positive comments (B-82). The repoﬁ also indicates that

Student is making satisfactory progress on her IEP goals and objectives.

Student is making satisfactory progress on her IEP goals and objectives.

Conclusions of Law
1. BOE found Student to be eligible for special education and related services as deﬁned in the Individuals

with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 11.8.0 Sec. 1401, et seq.; Connecticut General Statutes §
10-76a, et seq.

2. School districts must have in effect policies and procedures to ensure that all children with disabilities
who are in need of special education and related services are identiﬁed, located, and evaluated. 34 CFR §
300.1 11.

3. The Hearing Ofﬁcer has the authority (A) to conﬁrm, modify, or reject the identification, evaluation
or educational placement of or the provision of a free appropriate public education (“FAPE”) t0 the
child or pupil, (B) to determine the appropriateness of an educational placement where the parent or
guardian ofa child requiring special education has placed the child or pupil in a program other than
that prescribed by the PPT, 01‘ (C) to prescribe alternate special educational programs for the child.
Connecticut General Statutes § 10—76h(d)(1).

4. Student has the burden of production in a special education due process hearing. Connecticut State
Regulations § 10-76h-l4.

5. BOE has the burden of proving the appropriateness of a student’s program or placement by a
preponderance of the evidence. Connecticut State Regulations § 10-7611—14.

6. The PPT includes the parents ofa child with a disability. 34 CFR § 300.321.

Where parents allege a procedural violation under the IDEA, a Hearing Ofﬁcer may find a denial of
FAPE if the violation 1) impeded the child's right to F APE; 2) signiﬁcantly impeded the parents'
opportunity to participate in the decision-mak'mg process regarding the provision of FAPE; 0r 3)
caused a deprivation of educational beneﬁts. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(E); 34 CFR § 300.513(a);
Winkelman v. Parma City Sch. Dist., 127 S. Ct. 1994, 2001 (2007).

The standard for determining whether FAPE has been provided is a two—pronged inquiry: first,
whether the procedural requirements of IDEA have been met, and second, whether the IEP is
reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational beneﬁts. Board of Education of the
Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowlev, 458 US. 176 (1982).

The proper gauge for determining educational progress is “whether the educational program
provided for a child is reasonably calculated to allow the child to receive ‘meaningful’ educational
benefits.” Mrs. B. v. Milford Board ofEducation, 103 F.3d 1114, 1120 (2d Cir, 1997).

An appropriate public education under IDEA is one that is “likely to produce progress, not
regression.” Walczak v. Fiorida Union Free Sch. Dist, 142 F.3d 1 19, 130 (2d Cir. 1998). The IDEA
does not require that the school district provide the best available educational program 01‘ one that
maximizes a student’s educational potential. Mrs. B. v. Milford Bd. of Educ., 103 F.3d 1 1 14, 1121
(2d Cir. 1997).

Factors to be considered in determining whether an IEP is reasonably calculated to provide a
meaningful educational beneﬁt is whether the proposed program is individualized 0n the basis of the

Discussion

Each of the issues identiﬁed in these consolidated cases are addressed in this Discussion section.
A11 of the parties’ arguments have been reviewed and considered by the Hearing Ofﬁcer and are not

necessarily individually addressed here. Certain arguments and claims will be addressed for illustrative

purposes.

I. Did the Board of Education fail to provide Student a free appropriate public education
during the 2011-12 school year?

Student was a sophomore at BOE’S High School in the 201 1-12 school year. Knowing from
Student’s Mother that Student had been diagnosed with major depression and was hospitalized at the
end of her freshman year, BOE’s Guidance Counselor asked to meet with Student’s Parents to discuss a
504 plan to provide Student with accommodations. Student’s Mother indicated that Student experienced
concentration issues when doing her homework.

Several accommodations were made, including extended time on assignments and tests,
palticipation in the LIFE Program, and periodic check in with Guidance Counselor. Student did check
in with Guidance Counselor on occasion and took advantage of some of the resources in the LIFE room.
She did not palticipate in the Human Re1ati0ns course in the LIFE room because it conﬂicted with an
honors level course that she wanted to take. Student’s Parents wanted her to remain in honors level
courses. They did not have concerns about Student’s academic abilities.

Student’s self-injurious behaviors resumed in fall of sophomore year. They escalated over the
winter break. Prior to January 2012, Student was performing well academically, received A’s and B’s,
and was enrolled in honors courses.

In January 2012, Student was again hospitalized and then discharged to a residential placement.
After this second hospitalization, BOE initiated a referral for special education. BOE conducted an
evaluation and developed an IEP for Student. The IEP accommodated Student’s need for a therapeutic
residential placement to provide her with counseling and to keep her safe and established goals and

13

June 24, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0300/13—0341

objectives related to organization and study skills and ability to manage anxiety and stress. At the PPT
meeting in which Student was determined to be eligible for special education services, BOE agreed to
pay for Student’s private school tuition retroactive to the date of placement. BOE did not agree to pay
for the residential p01ti011 0f Student’s placement.

The issues that were identiﬁed for resolution in the therapeutic program related to family and
personal issues, not school or academic issues. Student’s need for a therapeutic residential placement
did not relate to academic deﬁciencies but to psychiatric issues surrounding her family and personal life.

In March 2012, Student scored in the goal or advanced range on all subjects on the CAPT.
Student’s private placement indicated that she was performing well academically in the private special
education school. BOE worked with Student’s private placement to provide challenging coursework,
including honors and college preparatory classes.

Student’s argument with regard to provision of FAPE during the 2011—12 school year is centered
on BOE’s refusal to pay for the residential portion of Student’s private placement.

Student was not placed residentially for educational reasons. Student’s residential placement
was necessary to keep her safe and provide her the therapies necessary to deal with her severe
depression and related mental health issues.

Student was not disruptive at school, was able to learn in regular classes, and was capable of
beneﬁting from her education. Student was capable ofderiving, and did derive, educational beneﬁt
outside of the 1'esidentia1 placement.

Student’s progress in the residential portion 01‘ her placement is not primarily judged by
educational achievement but by progress in her therapies and refraining from self—injurious behavior.

“When a child's behavioral and emotional problems are so closely intertwined with his
educational difﬁculties that he requires residential placement, the school board must pay for that
placement as long as it is appropriate.” Plainville Board of Education v. RN, 2012 US Dist, LEXIS
46995, citing Mrs. B. v. Milford Board ofEducation, 103 F.3d 114, 1122 (2"d Cir. 1997).

In this case, Student’s behavioral and emotional problems were not closely intertwined with any
educational difﬁculties. BOE was not required to assume the cost of Student’s residentia1 placement in
order to provide Student with FAPE. Student was a high—performer who continued to excel

academically both at BOE’S High School and later in the private placement.

14

June 24, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13—0300/13—0341

Student’s private residential placement is not primarily oriented toward enabling her to receive
an education.4 The fact that Student needs to be in a therapeutic residential placement to resolve and
deal with psychiatric issues related to family and personal matters and can not attend BOE’S public high
school at the same time does not mean that she needs residential placement to access her education.

Therefore, BOB did not fail to provide Student FAPE during the 2011—12 school year.5

11. Did the Board of Education fail to provide Student 3 free appropriate public education
during the 2012 extended school year?

A school district must convene a PPT meeting to determine whether extended school year
(“ESY”) services are necessary to the provision ofFAPE. 34 CFR § 300.106. There is no evidence that
BOE convened a PPT meeting to determine whether ESY services were necessary for the provision 01°
FAPE to Student,

A factor to consider in determining whether a student determined to be eligible for special
education services needs ESY is whether the student would revert to a lower level of functioning as a
result of interruption of educational services during the summer.

Uncontrovetted testimony indicates that Student’s ﬁnal grade repon for the 201 1-12 school year
reﬂects grades ranging from 92 to 100 and teacher comments indicated “outstanding academic
progress,” “outstanding effott,” and other positive comments; that Student continued to excel
academically in the 2012-13 school year as BOB worked with Student’s Parents to provide more
challenging academic coursework, including honors and AP classes; and that Student’s November 2012
progress report reﬂected ﬁnal grades ranging from 95 to 100 and teacher comments again indicated
“outstanding academic progress,” “outstanding effott,” and other positive comments.

Student did not revert to a lower level of academic functioning as a result of interruption of
educational services during the summer. In this case, failure to convene a PPT to determine whether
ESY services are necessaly did not result in a denial ofFAPE or deprivation ofeducational beneﬁts.

BOE did not fail to provide Student FAPE during the 2012 extended school yeai:

4 There was consistent uncontroverted testimony that Student had two goals for her treamtent at that time: to decrease
destructive behaviors and resolution around the divorce of her parents’and an alleged incident with her stcp-brother
(Testimony of Student’s Mother, Private Special Education School T herapist).

5 Facts and analysis related to the propriety ofBOE’s evaluation and child ﬁnd obligations during the 201 1-12 school
year are addressed separately below under Issues 111 and IV,

15

June 24, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0300/13—0341

111. Did the Board of Education fail to timely and appropriately evaluate Student?

Student argues that the fact that she began engaging in seltlinjurious behaviors in fall 2010, that
she had low quiz grades in one class in March 201 1, and that Student’s Mother notiﬁed BOE staff in
April 2011 that Student had been diagnosed with 111ajordepression put BOE on notice that she should
have been evaluated for special education in 2011.

The evidence presented suppoﬂs a ﬁnding that BOE staff were not aware of Student’s self—
injurious behaviors at that time and that her school behavior and educational performance were not
impacted. In April 201 1, Student’s Mother indicated to Student’s teachers that she (Student’s Mother)
was shocked to ﬁnd out that Student had been “profoundly unhappy for some time.” Student’s Mother
testiﬁed that Student’s teachers were surprised to learn of her condition as they did not see a negative
impact on her behavior or academic performance,

During Student’s May 2011 hospitalization, Student’s teacher and Guidance Counselor worked
with Student’s Parents to provide her with coursework and to ensure that she completed her academic
requirements. Absence from school and diagnosis of major depression, absent an impact on educational
performance, do not necessarily require a school district to evaluate a child for special education. In her
brief, Student talks about “numerous red ﬂags” — i.e. BOE'S knowledge that Student was diagnosed with
depression and that Student had missed the end 01" the 2010—1 1 school year — as notice of Student’s
disability and “its impact on her education.” However, she does not cite any negative impact on her
educational performance, other than low quiz scores in one class.

BOE did not convene a PPT at that time but digi offer Student 504 accommodations in the 201 1-
12 school year. Student cites three situations that she claitns are evidence of difﬁculties in school that
should have caused BOE to convene a PPT (ﬁnding the content of a required reading book to be
triggering, not feeling comfortable standing in front of a class doing a skit, and having a rough day such
that she did not have time to review for a quiz). LIFE Program Coordinator6 testiﬁed that other students
have found certain educational materials triggering and had alternative assignments. Student’s Mother
and BOB staff consistently and credibly testiﬁed that Student is shy, which may be consistent with not
feeling comfortable standing in front of a class.

Student’s brief states “[t]he LIFE program teacher testiﬁed that if she had known the extent of
[Student’s] behaviors, she would not have agreed that the LIFE program at [High School] could

6 LIFE Program Coordinator is also a Special Education Teacher.

16

June 24, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0300/13-0341

adequately support [Student]? This supports a ﬁnding that BOE staff did not know the extent of
Student’s behaviors or emotional issues at that time to trigger a special education referral.

When BOE learned that Student had been hospitalized a second time, Guidance Counselor
immediately made a referral to special education and set up a PPT, Student’s evaluation included an
educational performance review and a psychiatric evaluation.

BOE did not fail to timely and appropriately evaluate Student.

IVT Did the Board of Education fail to properly identify Student as eligible for special
education services?

BOE referred Student for special education, conducted an evaluation, and determined her to be
eligible for special education sewices. Student’s argument on this issue appears to be surrounding
Student’s Mother’s position that Student should have been found eligible under SED instead ot‘OI-II.

To be eligible under SED, Student must exhibit, to a marked degree, ceitain enumerated
conditions and that, as a result of these behaviors, her educational performance was adversely affected.
There is not disagreement that Student exhibited to a marked degree inappropriate types of behavior or
feelings under normal circumstances or a general pewasive mood of unhappiness or depression. T here
is no evidence that, as a result of those behaviors, her educational performance was adversely affected.

Regardless of whether one category is a better ﬁt than another, the category under which Student
is identiﬁed does not dictate the services to be provided. The services needed and provided are based on
Student’s present level of performance and educational needs, not on a label.

BOE did not fail to properly identify Student as eligible for special education services.

V. Did the Board of Education fail to provide Student :1 free appropriate public education
during the 2012-13 school year?

Student’s argument with regard to FAPE for the 2012—13 school year is the same as her argument
with regard to the 2011—12 school year ~ that BOE failed to provide FAPE when it refused to pay for the
residential portion of Student’s therapeutic placement:

As stated above, Student’s behavioral and emotional problems were not closely inteltwined with
any educational difﬁculties. The fact that Student needs to be in a therapeutic residential placement to
resolve and deal with psychiatric issues related to family and personal matters and can not attend BOE’s

17

 

June 24, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0300/13-034]

public high school at the same time does not mean that she needs residential placement to access her

education.

BOE did not fail to provide Student FAPE during the 2012—13 school year.

VI. If the answer to any of the above Issues One through Five is in the affirmative, what shall
be the remedy?
The answer 10 each 01‘ the above Issues One through Five is in the negative and, therefore, a

remedy need not be ordered.

VII. Shall the Board of Education be permitted to conduct a psychiatric evaluation of Student
in the absence of parental consent?

BOB argues that it learned more about Student’s psychiatric issues and condition from exhibits
offered in this case and that, as a result, it feels the need to conduct an updated psychiatric evaluation to
determine whether Student’s program is appropriate.

Throughout this case and hearing, BOB has argued that Student’s psychiatric condition and need
for residential placement are akin to a medical placement and are unrelated to Student’s educational
needs. BOE has pointed to Student’s educational performance at both BOE’s High School and at
Private Special Education School as an indication that she does not need residential placement to
succeed academically. Student has continued to excel academically despite any setbacks in her mental
health and family issues.

The record is devoid of evidence that Student’s educational performance or ability to succeed
academically has deteriorated in any way. A change in what BOE deems to be Student’s medical
condition, absent any impact on her educational performance, does not give rise to a need to 1'e-evaluate
Student absent parental consent.

Under this current factual scenario, BOB shall not be permitted to conduct a psychiatric

evaluation of Student in the absence of parental consent.
