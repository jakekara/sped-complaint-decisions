the Student submitted a written request for a thirty-day postponement and extension of the timelines to
conduct the hearing and to ﬁle the ﬁnal decision for the purpose of allowing the parties time to attempt a
resolution of the case.

The request was granted and the deadline was extended. On January 7, 2015, the ﬁrst of two days of
scheduled hearings was convened. The parties reported that they had reached a settlement agreement in
principal and were very close to ﬁnalizing the agreement. The Student requested cancellation of the
scheduled hearings. The request was granted, as well as a request for an additional extension of the

Student reported that the dispute had been resolved, and requested that the case be dismissed with

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

It is ordered that the Student’s request for dismissal is granted and this matter is dismissed with prejudice.

receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
