 Appearing before:             Attorney  Christine B. Spak 
Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:    1. Whether the Board failed to provide a free, appropriate public education 
(FAPE). 2.  Whether the Board failed to educate by properly constructing and 
implementing IEP, meeting goals and objectives according to the 
Student&#8482;s academic needs. 
3.  Whether the Board failed to place the Student in a suitable placement. 
4.  Whether the Board was incorrect in finding that an October 20, 2005 
incident was not a manifestation of the Student&#8482;s disability or a serious 

emotional disturbance. 
 SUMMARY:  The Student was fifteen years old at the time of hearing in 2006 and had entered the 

Board&#8482;s schools from out of state in 2002.  
When he entered the Groton schools he had 
already been identified as a student with a learning disability.  There have been three due 

process requests filed by the Parent between June 2005 and January 2006, two of them 

resulting in fully litigated due process hearings.  In the instant matter the Parent&#8482;s main 

concern, based on her actions and evidence, appears to be the Student&#8482;s difficulty 
reading.  It is agreed by the parties that the Student is a generally well behaved boy, well 
liked by peers and teachers.  However, in September and October 2005 he committed two 

acts, the first involving fireworks he gave to a friend who set them off in school which 

led to the discovery of a gun facsimile on the Student at school and the second involving 

a pipe bomb set off by an acquaintance in the Student&#8482;s neighborhood with the Student 

watching, that resulted in suspensions and the recommendation that Student be placed in 

an alternative forty five day placement.     The mother did not send him to the alternative
