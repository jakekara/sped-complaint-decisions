      FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  This matter began in November 2004 before a hearing officer who recused herself after 
the first day of hearing for matters unrelated to this case.  The hearing proceeded before 
the current hearing officer beginning with a hearing date on December 9, 2004.  The 
Student filed another case against the Board, numbered 04-379 which was assigned to 
another hearing officer.  The Board filed a Motion to Consolidate, and, in accordance with the law the two hearing officers conferred and agreed that the matters should be 

consolidated into this case (No. 03-334).  On January 6, 2005 the parties were informed 
of this on the record and there was agreement that to make the record more 
understandable the parties would refile their respective Motion and Objection with the hearing officer in this case so that the record in this matter would be clear and complete. 
That was done and on January 13, 2005 the Board&#8482;s Motion to Consolidate was granted 
in writing.  On March 7, 2005, the sixteenth day of hearing, the parties informed the 
hearing officer that they were in settlement negotiations and requested time to pursue 
this.  This request was granted and the parties reported back in the afternoon that the 
matter had been resolved and could be dismissed with prejudice. 
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The matter is 
DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
