September 22, 2003 -1-         Final Decision and Order 03-258         (Partial - Stay Put Issues Only)     STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION  Student v. Groton Board of Education      Appearing for the Parents:   David C. Shaw, Esq.       34 Jerome Avenue, Suite 210       Bloomfield, CT  06002  Appearing for the Board:   Marsha Belman Moses, Esq.       Berchem, Moses & Devlin, P.C.       75 Broad Street       Milford, CT  06460  Appearing Before:    Hearing Officer Scott P. Myers, M.A. (Clinical        Psychology), J.D.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER (Partial &#338; Regarding Stay Put Issues Only) September 22, 2003  SUMMARY   The Student graduated from the Board&#8482;s high school on June 20, 2003 with a regular high school diploma and turned 21 years of age on August 18, 2003.  At all pertinent points before June 20, 2003, she had been attending the May Center in Massachusetts at Board expense pursuant to a series of IEPs.  The Student attended the May Center in the period June 21, 2003  through August 18, 2003 at Board expense not as the result of an IEP, but as the result of a unilateral offer made by the Board at a PPT on April 10, 2003 to fund her attendance at the May Center in that period.  The Parents were advised by the Board on April 10, 2003 that after August 18, 2003 the Board would cease providing all or funding any educational services to the Student.  The Parents claim that they did not commence due process before August 12, 2003 because the Board failed to notify them of or misrepresented their rights under the applicable laws and the Parents did not know until late July or early August 2003 that they could commence due process to challenge the Board&#8482;s decision to graduate the Student or to obtain special education and related services beyond the date of her 21st birthday.  When they commenced due process on August 12, 2003, they also sought an &#64257;emergency&#64258; order compelling the Board to fund a placement at the May Center beyond August 18, 2003 on the basis of stay put.  For the reasons set forth more fully herein, the Hearing Officer&#8482;s September 5, 2003 order denying relief under the IDEA Stay Put Provision (the &#64257;September 5 Stay Put Order&#64258;) is AFFIRMED and the Parents&#8482; subsequently asserted request for relief under the CT Stay Put Provision is DENIED.  Whether the Student is entitled to relief on the merits of her due process claim, which is asserted under Connecticut special education law rather than the IDEA, is independent of the issue of whether she is entitled to stay put relief.  The Hearing Officer reaches no conclusions herein on the merits of her due process claim.
