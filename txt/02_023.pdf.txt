While a prehearing conference was attempted with the Father, he did not remain on the phone line for the prehearing to commence with counsel for the Board.1  The hearing convened on February 28, 2002.  The Board representative, Board counsel, Mother, Father and maternal grandparents were present at the hearing.  Prior to the hearing, the Mother had indicated that she agreed with the evaluation completed by the Board.  The preliminary issue at the hearing was whether there continued to be an issue to be heard, or whether the Father was requesting that the Board provide independent evaluations for the Student.  To the extent that the summary and findings of fact actually represent conclusions of law, they should be so considered, and vice versa. Bonnie Ann F. v. Callallen Independent School Board, 835 F.
