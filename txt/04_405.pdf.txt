  FINAL ORDER AND DECISION  ISSUE:  Was the Student&#8482;s behavior that resulted in disciplinary action by the Board, a 
manifestation of the Student&#8482;s disability? 
 SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  The student is a 14 year-old young man who has been identified as Other Health 

Impaired-ADD/ADHD and is entitled to receive a free appropriate public education as 
defined in 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;1401 et seq.  The Student&#8482;s behavior violated a school rule or code of conduct and resulted in a disciplinary hearing where the IEP team decided that 

the behavior was not a manifestation of the Student&#8482;s disability.  The Parents objected to 
the manifestation determination and requested an Expedited Due Process Hearing as 

defined in 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;1401 et seq, 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.523 and Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies &#167;10-76h-10.  On December 23, 2004, a Hearing Officer was a
ppointed.  A pre-hearing conference was held on January 4, 2005 and hearing dates were of January 14 and 20, 2005 were chosen by the parties. The Parents originally were proceeding Pro Se but on January 13, 2005 the Hearing Officer received notice that the Parents were now represented by counsel.
