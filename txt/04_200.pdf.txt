Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  SUMMARY:  This matter was assigned on June 29, 2004, and a prehearing conference was held 
on July 8.  The hearing was scheduled for August 4.  On July 27, the Parents&#8482; attorney submitted a notice that the Student had run away 
from the school he was attending, but had been found.  He was to be returning to the 
State, so the Parents&#8482; attorney requested that the hearing be postponed so that the Board could evaluate the Student upon his returning to the State.  The Board&#8482;s attorney submitted a response to the request, opposing the 
postponement and did not agree to proceed with an evaluation, as there was an issue as to 
the Student&#8482;s consent to the evaluation. The Board&#8482;s attorney noted that the Student had now reached the age of 18.  The records indicated that the Student reached the age of 18 
on July 15. [Exhibit P-2]  The request for postponement was denied, and the Parents&#8482; 
attorney was ordered to submit verification of representation of the Student. 
 On August 3, the Parents&#8482; attorney submitted notification that the Student had not 
yet given consent to his representation, and noted that the Student may be incapable of 

making this decision at this time as he is seriously in need of treatment.  The Parents&#8482;
