Has the Board provided the student with appropriate assistive technology?  PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  Due process hearing was requested by letter from the parent dated October 12, 2001 (H.O.-1) and the hearing officer was appointed on October 15, 2001.  Prehearing conference took place on October 26, 2001.  Hearing of this matter was convened on November 5, 2001, at which time the parent presented her case.  The parties appeared for hearing on November 26, 2001, but the parent was too ill to proceed.  To permit the parties to complete testimony and to overcome the difficulties of scheduling hearing dates in the last two weeks of December, the hearing officer granted the Board&#8482;s motion for extension of time for mailing the final decision and order to February 1, 2002.  Continued hearing of this matter was to have taken place on January 10 and 17, 2002.  On January 9, 2002, however, the parent notified the hearing officer that she had just been discharged from the hospital and could not go forward on January 10, 2002.  On January 16, 2002, the parent notified the hearing officer that she was still to ill to proceed and would be withdrawing her request for due process hearing.  Although ten days have elapsed, no further communication has been received from the parent.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  This matter is dismissed without prejudice.
