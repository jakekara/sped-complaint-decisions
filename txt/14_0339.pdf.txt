PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On January 8, 2014, the Ridgeﬁeld Board of Education received a Request for a Special
Education Due Process Hearing. The undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on January 9,
2014. On February 5, 2014, a preheating conference was held and hearing dates of March, 26,
2014, April 2, 2014 and May 7, 2014 were set. The original deadline for the mailing of the Final
Decision and Order was established as March 24, 2014. During the preheating conference,
Counsel for the Parents requested an extension of the deadline for the mailing of the Final
Decision and Order in order to accommodate additional hearing dates. The extension request was
granted and April 23, 2014 was established as the new deadline for the mailing of the Final
Decision and Order. On March 3, 2014, Attorney for Board indicated that there was a conﬂict
with a previously scheduled April 2, 2014 hearing date and requested that the date of May 5,
2014 be substituted. On March 13, 2014, Attorney for the Student requested that the initial

date. After consideration of all factors, both requests were granted and new hearing dates of
May 5, 2014 and May 7, 2014 were set. On March 13, 2014, Attorney for the Student also
requested an extension of the mailing deadline to accommodate the new hearing date schedule
and this request was granted. A new deadline for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order
was set for May 23, 2014. On April 10, 2014, the Attorney for the Student requested a

pertaining to Student’s family. There was no objection to this request from the Board. An
extension of the mailing deadline was also requested. Both requests were granted. The deadline
for mailing the Final Decision and Order was extended to June 22, 2014 and a new hearing date
of J une 20, 2014 was set. On June 12, 2014, Counsel for the Parents withdrew the hearing
