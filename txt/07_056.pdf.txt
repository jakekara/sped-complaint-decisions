  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
   ISSUE:  Shall the Board provide an independent comprehensive reading evaluation for Student? 
  PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  This hearing was requested on February 27, 2007, and the hearing officer was appointed on March 6, 2007.  A pre-hearing conference was held on March 14, 2007, and the hearing was scheduled for May 2, 2007, with the decision due to be mailed by May 13, 
2007.  Subsequently, the Board agreed to an independent evaluation to be performed by 
Dr. Miriam Cherkes-Julkowski.  The Parent 
requested that the hearing be postponed, and that request was granted: the hearing was re-scheduled for May 31, 2007, and the decision deadline was extended to June 12, 2007.    By letter dated May 9, 2007, and addressed to Board&#8482;s current attorney, Parent discussed the agreement for the evaluation scheduled 
for May 3, 2007, and questioned the need for a hearing.
