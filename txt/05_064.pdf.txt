Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   PROCEDURAL HISTORY   The Mother filed a hearing request on March 17, 2005.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the due process case on that date.  A prehearing conference was scheduled on March 24.  On March 22, Atty. Laubin filed an appearance for the Board.  On that date, the Mother called the Hearing Officer and left a voice mail message stating that she was 
not available on March 24 and requested that the prehearing conference be rescheduled for March 28.  On March 23, the Hearing Officer wrote to the parties and advised them 

that the prehearing conference could be rescheduled at 8:30 a.m. on March 28 as 
requested by the Mother and that the Board's attorney should notify the Hearing Officer if 
that date and time was acceptable to both parties.  Later that day the Board's attorney 
faxed a letter to the Hearing Officer confirming that date and time for the prehearing.  
Atty. Klebanoff filed an appearance for the Parents on March 23 and indicated that he 
wished to withdraw the case without prejudice in order to have time to review the records 
and try to resolve the matter amicably.  
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  It is ordered that this case is dismissed without prejudice.
