SUMMARY:

convened on September 18, 2009.  The Parents&#8482; attorney submitted a request for an extension of the mailing 

date of the decision so that the parties had an opportunity to attempt to settle this case through mediation.  That 

request was granted, and the hearing was scheduled to convene on November 24, 2009. 
Subsequently, the Parents&#8482; attorney submitted a second request for an extension of the mailing date of 
the decision and a postponement of the scheduled hearing date which was denied as it was not filed in a timely 

manner

the case. Pursuant to Conn. Regulations of Agencies Sec. 10-76h-9(3), the hearing officer shall not have the 
authority to grant any further postponements or 
extensions for continued settlement discussions 
At the first hearing date on November 24, 2009, the Board&#8482;s attorney was present and reported the case 
had settled. The Parents&#8482; attorney was not present.
