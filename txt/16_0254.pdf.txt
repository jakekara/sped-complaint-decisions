ISSUES:

1. Was the program provided by the Board for the 2013-2014 school year appropriate and did it
provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (F APE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE)?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals
With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-
7621 et seq, At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents requested that the Student be
placed at Meliora Academy in Meriden, CT for the 2015-2016 school year. The Board denied the Parents’
request and the Parents ﬁled for due process. On November 20, 2015, the Board received notice of the
Parents’ request for due process. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on November 20, 2016 and
a pre-hearing conference was held on December 1, 2015. The parties agreed to forego a resolution
meeting and mediate the matter on February 18, 2016. In an electronic transmission, the Parents attorney
informed the hearing ofﬁcer that the Parents were withdrawing the matter without prejudice and were
going to attend a PPT to resolve the matter. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order was
extended to March 4, 2016 to accommodate the mediation date.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed School district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state 01' federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
