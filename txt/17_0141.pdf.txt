Violation of the IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act
and the Civil Rights Act?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On September 8, 2016, the Parents ﬁled two documents with the State Department of Education. The ﬁrst
document was a completed Connecticut State Department of Education (“CSDE”) Complaint form and the
second was a letter which was addressed to the Bureau of Special Education - Due Process Unit. These two
documents were initially accepted by the CSDE as a complaint rather than a request for a due process
hearing, but after review of the pleading the CSDOE directed Parents to reﬁle their letter with a completed
CSDE Due Process Hearing Request form which Parents did on September 20, 2016. The Board received
both the original set of documents and the second set of documents at the time each set was ﬁled With the
State. On September 20, 2016, the CSDE appointed the undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer to preside over the
matter. During the prehearing conferences held on September 27, 2016 and on November 4, 2016, Attorney
for the Parents registered her obj ection to using the second ﬁling date, arguing that the District had notice
as of September 8, 2016 of the Due Process Hearing Request. The Hearing Ofﬁcer determined that since
the original ﬁling contained documents Which conﬂicted with each other as to the procedure being sought,
it was proper to use the secondary ﬁling date in which both documents indicated that Parents were
requesting a due process hearing, rather than a complaint. Parents” obj ection to this determination was
noted for the record. During the initial preheating conference, hearing dates of November 15, 2016, and
November 21, 2016 were set and the deadline for mailing the ﬁnal decision and order was established as
December 2, 2016. Also at the prehearing conference, Parents” attorney indicated that Parents’ letter,
which had not accompanied the Due Process Request form when it was sent by the State to the Hearing
Ofﬁcer contained more speciﬁc information, which she felt needed to be included as part of the hearing
request. On September 27, 2016, Attorney for the Parent forwarded Parents’ letter which accompanied the
Due Process Hearing Request form. On October 4, 2016, after a review of Parent’s letter, the Hearing
Ofﬁcer sent an email to the Attorney for the Parent requesting clariﬁcation of the basis for Parents’ claim
for a retroactive violation of stay put. Attorney for the Parent sent a substantive email in response and the
Board was allowed time to respond to the questions posed by the Hearing Ofﬁcer and to Parent’s response
to same. On October 25, 2016, the Hearing Ofﬁcer sent a memorandum to the Parties with a list of issues
which included the issue of stay put during the current hearing and Parent’s claim of an ongoing stay—put
Violation spanning the statutory two-year period. On November 1, 2016, Attorney for the Parent sent an
email which set forth a number of what she termed "corrections/amendrnents” t0 the list of issues generated
by the Hearing Ofﬁcer after the prehearing conference and sent to Counsel. In response to the November 1,
2016 email from Attorney for the Parent, Hearing Ofﬁcer sought clariﬁcation as to whether Parent was
proposing clariﬁcations or amendments and determined that a second prehearing conference was needed to
clarify and identify Parents’ issues.

On November 9, 2016, permission was granted to Parent to amend the hearing request and an amended
request was ﬁled on November 1 1, 2016. This amendment restarted the deadlines for a resolution
conference and for holding the hearing and a new deadline of J anuary 25, 2016. The hearing dates of
November 15, 2016 and November 21, 2016 were postponed due to the restarting of the resolution period.
On November 14, 2016, the Board ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss and Sufﬁciency Challenge. On November 23,
2016, Parents ﬁled an Objection to Board’s Motion to Dismiss and Sufﬁciency Challenge. In this

Obj ection, Parents withdrew issue 15 and 16 from consideration by the Hearing Ofﬁcer without prej udice.
On November 25, 2016, Parents ﬁled a separate request for a due process hearing in which they sought to
have the two issues Which had been withdrawn from the 17-0141 hearing request adjudicated by a different
hearing ofﬁcer. The separate hearing request was assigned to Hearing Ofﬁcer Sylvia Ho and given the

 

 

J anuary 24, 2017 Final Decision and Order 17-0141/17-023 5 Consolidated

hearing number of 17—0235. On December 9, 2016, the Board ﬁled a motion to consolidate the 17-0141 and
17-0235. This motion was granted by Hearing Ofﬁcer Ho who issued an order consolidating Case 17—0235
and 17-0141 with this Hearing Ofﬁcer on December 12, 2016, effectively restoring Issues 15 and 16 to the
list of issues for consideration by this Hearing Ofﬁcer. Another prehearing conference was scheduled for
December 6, 2017 to identify new hearing dates. Attorney for Parent was unable to join the conference at
the appointed time and so additional hearing dates of January 10, 2017, J anuary 11, 2017, J anuary 23,
2017, February 7, 2017, F ebruary 9, 2017, February 10, 2017 and February 16, 2017 were scheduled by
email. Attorney for the Parent ﬁled a request for a 30 day extension of time for the hearing on December 6,
2016. As the agreed upon replacement hearing dates fell beyond the thirty day extension requested by
Attorney for the Parent, the request was moot and a ruling unnecessary. Parties were informed that the stay
put issue relating to Winston Preparatory School was a threshold issue, which would be litigated at the
outset of the hearing and that the ruling on the motion to dismiss would be issued on the ﬁrst date of
hearing as well. The ﬁrst rescheduled hearing dates, January 10, 2016 and J anuary 11, 2016 were
postponed. On J anuary 23, 2017, the hearing was opened and Counsel indicated on the record that they had
entered into a settlement agreement. Counsel were reminded that there were jurisdictional challenges
pending, and conﬁrmation was sought from Counsel that the agreement resolved all 16 issues set forth
above in this decision. Attorney for the Parents and Attorneys for the Board conﬁrmed that all issues were
resolved by the agreement. The parties jointly requested an extension of the deadline for mailing the ﬁnal
decision and order to J anuary 30, 2017 and this request was granted after a consideration of all of the
relevant factors under R.C.S.A. 10-76-h—9(d). Attorney for the Student then withdrew the amended request
for a hearing with prejudice.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

In light of the above facts, the case is dismissed.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for ‘
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Educatien shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the'hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
