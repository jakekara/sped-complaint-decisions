October 6, 1999 -2- Final Decision and Order 99-223      FINDINGS OF FACT:  This hearing was requested by the parent of B., a seventeen year old female student who has been identified as learning disabled.  Although the Board has put in place many modifications and has attempted various forms of special education programming, B.  is now three years behind with regard to the number of credits needed to graduate from high school.  It was necessary for her to repeat her freshman year of high school and she failed her sophomore year.  At a PPT held on August 30, 1999, the IEP team placed B. at the Forman School with the Board to assume the costs of tuition.  (Exhibit B-12).  At the hearing convened on October 1, 1999, both parties agreed that an outside placement was essential if B. was to have a fresh start.  They requested that the following agreement become the final decision and order in this case.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  1. The Board will place B. at the Forman School for the 1999-2000 school year.  2. The Board will place B. at the Forman School or a program similar to that of the Forman School for the summer of 2000.  3. At the annual review in the spring of 2000, it will be determined whether the Forman placement was successful.
