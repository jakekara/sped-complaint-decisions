 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  (April 15, 2008)  ISSUES SET FOR HEARING
  1. Whether the Student was denied a 
free appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as a result of the determinati
ons of the November 8, 2007 IEP team meeting 
and, if so, to what relief is she entitled? 
 
 2. Whether the Student was denied a FAPE as the result of the 

determinations made at any IEP team m
eeting between November 8, 2007 and February 6, 2008 and, if so, to what relief is she entitled? 
 BACKGROUND  This matter was commenced by the Student&#8482;s
 mother (the &#64257;Parent&#64258;) by request for 
due process dated January 4, 2008 and received by the Department on January 9, 2008.  
Hearing Officer Owens was appointed in this matter and recused herself.  The undersigned was appointed Hearing Officer on January 15, 2008.  The request identifies a 
November 8, 2007 IEP team meeting as the mee
ting at which the parties failed to reach agreement on the issue in dispute.  The request
 states that the Student is attending River Street School and seeks another placement
 because she has become increasingly 
distressed by the placement to the point at wh
ich she is at risk for having a seizure (a symptom apparently associated with her disability).   
 In contacting the Parent on January 18, 2008 to arrange the telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;), the Parent represented that she is the guardian or conservator of the 
Student who is over age 18 years of age, that the Hearing Officer may discuss the case 
with the Parent&#8482;s mother (&#64257;Grandmother&#64258;) 
who is actively involved in assisting the 
Parent with the Student, and that she is not represented by counsel at this time.  In 
contacting the Board on January 18, 2008 to arrange for the PHC, Mr. Gascoyne (Director of Pupil Services) advised that the Board is also not represented by counsel at this time.  Both parties agreed to
 receive communications by e-mail.
