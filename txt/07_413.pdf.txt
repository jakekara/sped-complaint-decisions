 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  ISSUES:  
From the request for hearing, 
it appears that Parent contended that Student required additional support in regular education classrooms, including but not limited to one-to-
one paraprofessional support, access to a computer, scribing, etc.  
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  This hearing was requested on January 26, 2008, and the hearing officer was appointed on January 31, 2008.  The decision was due for mailing on April 10, 2008.  A pre-hearing 
conference was scheduled for February 15, 2008.  At a resolution meeting held on 
February 8, 2008, the Board agreed to fourteen items, including increased specific 
paraprofessional support.  Parent agreed to a trial of these supports and modifications, 
and withdrew her request for hearing.  The pre-hearing conference was cancelled.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DISCUSSION:

es (CGS), authorizes an impartial hearing officer to conduct a special education hearing

with Sections 10-176e through 4-180a, inclusive, and Section 4-181a.  Section 615(f)(1)(A) and 615(f)(3)(E), Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act 
of 2004, also authorizes special education hearings.  2. According to Parent&#8482;s communication to the hearing officer on February 14, 2008, no issues remain in disput
