 The Parents requested this hearing by letter dated July 24 to the Granby Board of Education's Director of Special Services
 ("Director").  The 
Board and the State Department of Education ("SDE") received th
e request on July 25.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on July 26. On August 6, the Parents' attorney on behalf of both 
parties requested a 30-day postponement of
 the mailing date for the final decision 
because the parties had scheduled an advisory hearing on September 7.  A prehearing 
conference was held on August 8.  The mailing 
date for the final decision deadline was 
set at October 9, 2007.  One hearing date was agreed on for October 4.  The request for a 30-day extension of the mailing date for the 
final decision to November 8 was granted. 
 On October 4, the hearing convened with the Director and a Legal Assistant from the Parents' attorney's office.  She presented 
a letter from the Parents' attorney requesting 
a dismissal without prejudice until the partie
s have fully executed a settlement.  The 
Parents' attorney would then file a request 
for a dismissal with prejudice. The hearing was 
adjourned and the Parents' attorney's assist
ant was advised that th
e parties would have two weeks to file a request for a dismissal w
ith prejudice.  No request has been filed.  - 1 -
