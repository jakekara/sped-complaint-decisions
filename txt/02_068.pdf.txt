Hartford Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parent:  Non-Attorney Advocate* &#338; Frances Klein      12 Bellevue Street       East Hampton, CT 06424  Appearing on behalf of the Board:            Attorney Ann F. Bird       Assistant Corporation Counsel          City of Hartford-550 Main Street        Hartford, CT  06103     Appearing before:  Attorney Margaret J. Slez, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUES:  1. Did the Board properly determine that the student was no longer eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA?  2. Did the parent have a right to an independent educational evaluation under 34 CFR Section 300.502?   SUMMARY:  At the end of  the 1996-97 school year, in the third grade, the student was evaluated and found eligible for special education services based on the identification of a specific learning disability.  Intensive services were provided to the student over the course of two years in fourth grade, school years 1997-98 and 1998-99, and in fifth and sixth grade, school years 1999-2000 and 2000-2001.  In the fall of  2001, the triennial review was conducted  and the student, now in the seventh grade, was found to be no longer eligible for special education and related services.  The parent disagreed with the decision to exit the student from special education and requested further assessment by an independent evaluator.  The required Multidisciplinary Evaluation Report was not completed until a PPT meeting held on March 15, 2002.  The parent requested due process hearing by an undated letter received by the Due Process Unit on March 20, 2002. (Exhibit H.O.-1).
