                                         FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUE:  Are the Parents entitled to an independent speech and language evaluation of the Student?   SUMMARY/PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  The Student is fifteen years old and in the tenth grade at the school district high school.  The Student has not been identified as eligible to receive special education and related services.  The hearing was requested by the school district on October 30, 2003 after the Parents&#8482; request for an independent speech and language evaluation was denied at a PPT 
convened on October 23, 2003.  A prehearing conference notice setting a conference date for November 4, 2003 was sent to both partie
s;  the school district responded but the Parents did not.  A second prehearing conference notice was sent resetting the conference date for November 12, 2003.  The prehearing conference convened on November 12, 
2003;  the school district representative was present by telephone; the Parents could not be reached.  A hearing date was set for December 4, 2003.  A hearing notice and letter 

was sent to the Parents indicating that the prehearing conference had been held and a hearing date set; they did not respond to the letter or hearing notice.  The hearing convened on December 4, 2003.  The Parents did not attend the hearing.  Prior to 

convening the hearing, calls were made to the Parents&#8482; home, place of employment, and 
cellphone.  Messages were left but no response was received.  A busy signal was received at the Parents&#8482; home; the appropriate number was left for an automatic callback
