 PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
 The Parents filed a due process hearing request with the State Department of 
Education (SDE) on June 20, 2007.  A copy was r
eceived by the Regional School District No. 9 (Board) on June 21, 2007.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on June 22.  On June 22, Atty. McKeon filed an appearance for the Board.  A prehearing conference was held on July 9.  At the pr

mediate and hearing dates were scheduled

proper party in a due process complaint.  Conn. Gen. Stats., 10-76h(
a)(1).  The Parents&#8482; attorney does not 
mention in the complaint that the Student is a 
party or that he represents her.  In the response to the Motion to Dismiss, he states
:  &#64257;I represent the Parents in the above-referenced matter.&#64258;
