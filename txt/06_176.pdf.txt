  FINAL ORDER AND DECISION
  SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
:  The Student is a  22 year and 1 months old young woman who has been identified with 

Intellectual Disability and entitled to receive a fr
ee and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as 
defined in Individuals with Disabilities Edu
cation Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. At a May 18,
 2006 PPT, the guardians rejected the program 
and the Transition Plan offered by the Board fo
r the 2006-2007 school year. The Board received 
notice of the request for due process on or about 
June 16, 2006 and a Mediation meeting was held 
by the parties on or about August 7, 2006. 
On June 16, 2006 an impartial hearing officer 
was appointed. A pre-hearing conference was held 
on June 27, 2006 and a hearing date of August 4, 
2006 was chosen by the parties.  This hearing 
date was cancelled in order to allow the parties 
to proceed with mediation. Alternative hearing 
dates of August 31, 2006 and September 5, 2006 w
as chosen by the parties. The parties again 
requested cancellation of the hearing dates and an 
alternative hearing date of September 19, 2006 
was chosen. The guardians attorney in a letter advised the h
earing officer that the matter had been settled and 
withdrew the matter with prejudice.
