April 9, 2012 Case No. 12—0271/12-0293

Procedural Histogx:

This matter is before the Hearing Ofﬁcer pursuant to a Request for Due Process hearing,
ﬁled by the Simsbury Board of Education (“Board”) and received by counsel for the parent on
January 31, 2012: this was identiﬁed as Case No. 12-0271. A pi'e-hearing conference was held
on February 13, 2012, in which counsel for both parties attended and the issue as to whether the
Board would be required to provide the student with an Independent Educational Evaluation as
requested by the parents, was identiﬁed and agreed upon. An initial Due Process Hearing date
was set for March 27, 2012. On February 15, 2012, the student ﬁled a due process complaint,
subsequently identiﬁed as case no. 12—0293. The student requested that both matters be
consolidated, dated February 21, 2012. On February 22, 2012, the Board requested a
postponement of the March 27, 2012 Due Process Hearing for the purposes 01‘ using that date for
mediation. The Board also stated that it had no objection to the consolidation of the two cases.
The Board then submitted a sufﬁciency challenge to the Student’s complaint on February 23,
2012. On February 27, 2012, after consultation with this hearing ofﬁcer, Hearing Ofﬁcer Mary
Elizabeth Oppenheim, hearing ofﬁcer in Case No. 12-0293, ruled on both the issue of
consolidation and the sufﬁciency challenge. The request to consolidate Case No, 12—0293 with
Case No. 12-0271 was granted. Hearing Ofﬁcer Oppenheim found that the parent’s request for
hearing met the notice requirements for a request for hearing and was therefore sufﬁcient. The
two cases were consolidated under Case No. 12—0271 for the consolidated case. Mediation was
successfully held by the parties on March 27, 2012. Subsequent to mediation, both parties
submitted requests to withdraw their due process requests, with prejudice. The parent request

was dated March 29, 2012 and the Board request was dated March 30, 20121

 

April 9, 2012 Case No. 12—0271/12-0293

Final Decision and Order:
It is therefore ordered that:
Pursuant to the request by all paﬁies to withdraw their individual requests for
due process hearings, and with no matters outstanding in this consolidated
case, this consolidated matter, and each relevant individual matter, is

dismissed with prejudice.
