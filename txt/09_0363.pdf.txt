 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 
ISSUES:   1. Did the Board offer a free appropriate pub
lic education (FAPE) to the Student after 
she was identified as eligible for special education 
and related services at a Planning and Placement 
Team (&#64257;PPT&#64258;) meeting on December 18, 2008? 
 
 2. If not, should the Board have placed the St
udent at the Grove School or be required to 
reimburse the Parents for the costs of that program? 

 
 3. Should the Board have made a referral to a PPT at any time prior to November 2008 

in order to determine whether the Student should 
be evaluated for special education and related 
services? 

 
 4. If so, are the Pare
nts entitled to an award of compen
satory education to remedy that 
denial of FAPE to the Student for the 2006-2007, the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 school years?
