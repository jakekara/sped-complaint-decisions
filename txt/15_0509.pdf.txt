F INAL DECISION AND ORDER

Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq.

At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents were not in agreement with the

and requested due process pursuant to the provisions of 34 C.F.R. §300.502(b)(2)(i).

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on May 13, 2015 and a pre—hearing conference was
held on May 20, 2015. Hearing dates of June 23 and July 9, 2015 were chosen by the panties.

In an electronic transmission, dated June 16, 2015, the Boards’ attorney informed the hearing

Transitional Assessment. Based on the Parents’ withdrawal the Board withdrew their request for
due process with prejudice. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is June 26, 2015.
