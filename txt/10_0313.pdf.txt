Appearing before:  Attorney Mary Elizabeth Oppenheim, Hearing Officer FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
ISSUE: Whether the Board&#8482;s evaluation conduc
ted by Dr. Isenberg is appropriate. PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION: 
This case arose out of a formal request by the 
Parents at the Planning and Placement Team [PPT] 
meeting on January 26, 2010 that the Board pay fo
r another neuropsychologist evaluation to be conducted by an evaluator chosen by the Parents. The Board filed this due process request pursuant to 34 C.F.R. &#167;300.502(b) to defend the appropriateness of the neuropsychological evaluation conducted by Dr. Gary Isenberg. [Exhibit H.O.-1] 
The Parents received this request for hearing on February 3, 2010, 
and a prehearing conference was convened on February 12, 2010. This matter conv
ened on two hearing dates, March 11, 2010 and March 17, 2010. 
Prior to the matter convening the 
Parents&#8482; attorney submitted a no
tice that they 
&#64257;withdraw their request for an independent educational evaluation without prejudice,&#64258; [Exhibit H.O.-2] and subsequently requested that the case be dismissed 
as there was no case or controversy and that the 
matter was moot. [Exhibit H.O.-4]    

The Board objected to the Parents&#8482; request for dismissal as the Parents equivocated in withdrawing 
their request &#64257;with prejudice,&#64258; and after oral argument on the issue 
of mootness, the case proceeded 
with testimony by the Board&#8482;s director of sp
ecial education on the first hearing date.
