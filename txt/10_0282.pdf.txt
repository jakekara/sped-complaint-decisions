FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
A special education hearing in the above-captione
d matter was requested by 
Student via letter dated January 14, 2010. The request for due process hearing was received by the Due Process Unit on January 19, 2010. It is assumed that it was receiv
ed by the Board of Education on the same date. Therefore, the 30-day 
resolution period runs through February 18, 2010 and the deadline for mailing the final decision and order is 
April 4, 2010. The case was scheduled for a pre-hearing conference on February 5, 2010. Via letter dated February 1, 2010, Student withdrew the matter with prejudice b
ecause the parties reached a settlement at the 
resolution session. Based on Student&#8482;s withdrawal, the Hearing Officer cancelled the scheduled pre-hearing 
conference. The issues in this case were whether the Board of Education should reimburse Student for an out-of-district placement for the 2009-10 school year and whet
her the Board of Education denied Student a free appropriate public education. FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
In light of the above facts, the above-captioned case is hereby dismissed with prejudice.
