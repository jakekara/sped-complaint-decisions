    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  ISSUE  Whether the programming and placement for the student is appropriate. 
 SUMMARY  A prehearing conference was conducted in this matter on November 24, 2003.  The 

Student raised a preliminary issue regarding her request that the Board present their case 
first.  The Board objected.  Briefs were filed. Connecticut Regulations provide that &#64257;The party who filed for due process has the burden of going forward with the evidence.&#64258; &#167;10-
76h-14(a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.  Therefore, the Student&#8482;s Motion that the Board Be Required, in the First Instance, to Present Evidence Pertaining to the Appropriateness of the Student&#8482;s Program was denied.  Subsequent to the prehearing, the parties requested that the first two dates of hearing be canceled to allow time to pursue an Advisory Opinion and possible settlement.  This request was granted.  
The Hearing Officer arrived for the third originally scheduled hearing date on January 5, 
2004 and the Student&#8482;s counsel was present and the Board&#8482;s counsel was not.  The Student&#8482;s counsel indicated that the parties were actively trying to settle and it appeared likely, but the parties did not want to cancel the later hearing date for later that week.  At the last date of hearing the matter was reported settled to the parties&#8482; mutual satisfaction.   
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The matter is 
DISMISSED without prejudice.
