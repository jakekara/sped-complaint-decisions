PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student requested a special education due process hearing in the above—captioned
matter on June 10, 2014. The Impartial Hearing Ofﬁcer was assigned to the case on J une
11, 2014. A telephonic pre-hearing conference was held on June 19, 2014. Attorney
Meredith Braxton appeared on behalf of the Student and Attorney Abby Wadler appeared on
behalf of the Greenwich Board of Education. Hearings were scheduled for July 28, 2014,
July 29, 2014 and August 27, 2014.

The hearing was convened on July 28, 2014. At that time, each party reported that a
tentative settlement had been reached, but that the settlement could not be ﬁnalized because

a person who had certain information necessary to ﬁnalize the agreement was not available.
At the parties’ request, the Irnpaitial Hearing Ofﬁcer cancelled the hearing scheduled for
July 29, 2014 and allowed the panties time to gather the needed information and ﬁnalize
their settlement agreement.

On Monday, August 18, 2014, the Student submitted a written request for a fourteen-day
postponement and extension of the deadline to conduct the hearing and to ﬁle the ﬁnal
decision in this case to September 5, 2014. The purpose of the requested postponement and
extension was to allow time for the parties to ﬁnalize their settlement agreement. The Board
of Education did not oppose the requested postponement, and it was granted. In addition, at
the Student’s request, the Impartial Hearing Ofﬁcer cancelled the hearing scheduled for
August 27, 2014.

A telephonic status conference was conducted on August 27, 2014. The parties reported
that they were very close to ﬁnalizing their settlement. On the same day, the Student
requested an additional extension of the deadline to complete the hearings and ﬁle the ﬁnal
decision to September 19, 2014. Again, the request was granted.

On September 12, 2014, the Impartial Hearing Ofﬁcer directed the paities to report on the
status of their settlement agreement, noting that the deadline was approaching. On
September 15, 2014, the Board of Education reported that the settlement was very close to
ﬁnalization. The Student did not report. On September 16, 2014, the Impartial Hearing
Ofﬁcer invited the Student to request an additional postponement of the deadline for ﬁling
the ﬁnal decision by the end of the day if the Student required an additional postponement.
The Student did not respond.

The Student has failed to prosecute the hearing of this matter. The Regulations of
Connecticut State Agencies, Section 10—76h-18(a), provides that “the hearing ofﬁcer may
order, sua sponte, an entry of default or dismissal for failure of any party (1) to prosecute a
hearing.”

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

It is ordered that matter is dismissed without prejudice for failure to prosecute.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal

court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
