Fay, Shipman & Goodwin LLP, One Constitution Plaza, Hartford, CT  06103-1919     Appearing before: Attorney Patricia M. Strong, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  PROCEDURAL HISTORY   This hearing was requested on June 20, 2005.  This hearing officer was assigned to the case on June 21.  A prehearing conference was held on July 5, 2005 with the Parents&#8482; attorney and Dr. Anne C. Loughrain, Director of Pupil Services.  Hearing dates were scheduled for July 20 and 26 and August 16 and 18.  The Parents' attorney requested an extension of the decision deadline, which was granted.  The decision deadline was extended from August 5 to September 12, 2005.  On July 6 Atty. Fay appeared for the Board and requested a postponement of the July 20 hearing.  The request was granted and hearing dates were added on July 27 and 29.  The parties were directed to file witness lists and exhibits by July 19, which the Parents did.  The Parents filed Exhibits P-1 through P-6.  The Board filed Exhibits B-1 through B-69 on July 20.  On July 21 the Board filed Exhibits B-70, B-71 and B-72.  On July 25 the Board filed Exhibit B-73.    The hearing convened on July 26, 2005.  The first matter heard was objections to exhibits.  The Board objected to Exhibit P-7, which had been filed by the Parents less than 5 days prior to the hearing.  The Exhibit was entered subject to the 5-day rule.  The Parents&#8482; attorney had no objections to Exhibits B-1 through B-72.  She objected to Exhibit B-73 because it was filed less than 5 days prior to the hearing.  That Exhibit was entered subject to the 5-day rule.  The Parents&#8482; attorney requested that the Board state what student records were not part of the Board exhibits.  A discussion was had on that topic.  The June 20 request for due process was marked as Hearing Officer Exhibit (HO) 1.  Because it did not contain any statement of issues, the Parents&#8482; request for mediation dated May 23, 2005, which did set forth issues, was entered as HO-2.  The Parents&#8482; attorney waived an opening statement.  The Board&#8482;s attorney reserved her opening statement until commencement of the Board&#8482;s case.  The Parents then presented testimony from the Mother.  She completed her testimony on July 27 and 29.  Jill O&#8482;Donnell,
