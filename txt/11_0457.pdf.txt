ISSUES:

1. Did the Board deny the Student FAPE and interfere with the Parents’ right to meaningful palticipation
in the annual review ofthe 2010-201 1 [BF by (a) failing to assess progress in the goals and objectives and
(b) failing to allow the Parents to provide input to the Student’s Present Levels of Performance?

2. Did the Board unilaterally delete services from the Student’s February and April 201 1 IEP outside of

the PPT, thereby denying the Student FAPE?

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
SUNIMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public
education (“FAPE”) as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C.
§1401 et seq. and Connecticut Genera1 Statute §10-76a. At a PPT meeting, the Parents alleged that the
Board interfered with their right to meaningful participation in the Student’s IEP. The Board denied the
Parents allegations. The Parents ﬁled for due process. On or about May 22, 2011, the Board received
notice of the Parents’ request for due process. A resolution meeting was scheduled.

An impaltial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on May 22, 201 1, and a pre—hearing conference was
scheduled for June 6, 201 1. A Sufﬁciency Motion was ﬁled on June 5, 201 1. The request for due
process was found not to be sufﬁcient. The Parents filed an amended request for due process on July 1,
201 1. The amended request changed the timeline for the request for due process.

In a letter, the Student’s Parents requested a withdrawal of their due process request without prejudice.
The Parents’ attorney had a medical issue and would not be able to present the Parents’ case in a timely
manner. The Board did not object to the withdrawal without prejudice. The date for the mailing of the
Final Decision and Order is October 12, 201 1.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISNHSSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
