Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUE:  I. Whether the Local Educational Agency (LEA) can propose a diagnostic 
placement to evaluate a disabled child when the parent has withdrawn consent 
to evaluate the child?  PROCEDURAL HISTORY  The parent filed a claim for a hearing when she and the LEA failed to reach an agreement 
for an evaluation in a diagnostic placement.  The LEA filed for a hearing with the same 
issue after the parent&#8482;s counsel withdrew from the case.  At the request of the LEA the 
two cases were joined under the same case number.  The parent subsequently refused to 
participate in a telephone planning conference, withdrew her claim for hearing; the 
hearing proceeded in her absence.  SUMMARY  The child is identified as having attention deficit disorder (ADD), serious emotional 

disturbance (SED) and a specific learning disab
ility.  He fails to progress in his individual 
education program (IEP) despite extensive modifications to his program and behavior 

intervention plan (BIP).  The IEP team obtai
ned input from two independent consultants, 
provided an alternative education program and now seeks comprehensive assessments in 

a diagnostic placement as a foundation for developing an appropriate IEP for the child.  

The parent withdrew consent to evaluate and opposes the diagnostic placement chosen by 
the LEA.
