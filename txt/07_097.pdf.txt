needs?

representative telephoned the hearing officer in the evening of April 24 to request a delay in the pre-hearing conference because the

graduation credits had not been completed. 
 The hearing officer postponed the pre-hearing conference to May 3, 2007, to provide time for the remaining issues to be 

addressed.  At the pre-hearing conference on May 3, 2007, the parties reported that all issues had been resolved.  The hearing officer requested that Parent send a written withdrawal of the
