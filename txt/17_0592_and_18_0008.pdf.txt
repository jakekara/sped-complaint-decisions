SUMMARY AND 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
 
 
Case 17
-
0592 was commenced by
 
the Enfield Board of Educat
ion by request received by the 
S
tate Department of Education on June 26, 2017.  A pre
-
hearing conference was held on July 6, 
2017
.  At the prehearing conference, a hearing date was set for August 22, 2017.  In a response 
to a re
quest made by both parties, the decision date was extended to September 8, 2017.
 
 
The parents made a request for Due Process Hearing which was received by the Board on July 6, 
2017 and designated Case 18
-
0008.  The case was assigned to Hearing Officer Bret
te Fitton, who 
ordered the cases consolidated on July 21, 2017.  The consolidation extended the decision date 
on the combined cases to September 19, 2017.
 
 
On August 18, 2017, the Board requested a postponement of the scheduled hearing as the parties 
were 
in mediation.  Later that day, the Board reported that the matters had been resolved and 
requested that they be dismissed with prejudice.  By electronic mail the next day, the parents 
confirmed that the cases had been resolved.
 
 
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
 
 
Both cases are
 
dismissed with prejudice.
