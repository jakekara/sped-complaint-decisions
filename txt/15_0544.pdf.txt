PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On May 29, 2015, the Board received a Special Education Due Process Hearing Request ﬁled by

the deadline for mailing the Final Decision and Order was established as August 12, 2015. On July 8,
2015, Attorney for the Student requested the postponement of the ﬁrst hearing date in order to allow the
parties to engage in private mediation on that date. 011 July 13, 2015, Attorney for the Student
submitted a request to extend the deadline for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order to
accommodate the hearing schedule should the mediation be unsuccessful. The Board did not object to
either of Student’s requests. After fully considering the position of the parties and all of the relevant
factors, both of Student’s requests were granted on July 13, 2015. The deadline for the mailing of the
Final Decision and Order was extended to September 11, 2015. On July 27, 2015, Attorney for the
Student requested a postponement of the August 25, 2015 hearing date. This request was denied. On
August 20, 2015, Attorney for the Student sent an email to the Hearing Ofﬁcer in Which she stated the
Parents were withdrawing their Special Education Due Process Hearing Request with prejudice.
