                 Berchem, Moses & Devlin, P.C. 
      75 Broad Street

 Appearing Before:    Attorney Gail K. Mangs, Hearing Officer 
                                         FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  This hearing was requested on November 19, 2003 although a statement of issues was 
never provided.  The prehearing conference was convened on November 25, 2003.  The 
conference was confirmed by telephone with the Student&#8482;s Mother on November 24, 
2003, but the privacy block on the Mother&#8482;s telephone was not disabled so the conference 
call operator was unable to reach her; the prehearing conference went forward with the Board&#8482;s attorney and the hearing officer.  A letter explaining this situation was sent to the Mother along with a hearing notice setting the hearing date for December 22, 2003 

(Exhibit H.O.-2);  the Mother did not respond to this letter.  The Board attorney sent letters to the Mother dated December 1 and December 8, 2003, attempting to schedule 
mediation (Exhibits H.O.-3 and -4); the Mother did not respond to either letter.  The 

hearing convened on December 22, 2003 on 10:00 a.m.; the Mother was not in 
attendance.  The Mother was telephoned and a message was left;  shortly thereafter, the 
Mother called back, stated that she would attend and requested that we wait for her.  The 
Mother, Student and his Stepfather then appeared at the hearing.  The parties were given time to confer after which the parties stated that they had agreed to mediation.  The 

hearing officer stated that the hearing would therefore be dismissed without prejudice to 

refile should that become necessary.  Neither party objected to this course of action. 
   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  This hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
