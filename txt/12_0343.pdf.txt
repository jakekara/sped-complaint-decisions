FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUE:

 

Did the Board’s use of physical restraint on the Student result in a denial of the free, appropriate public
education in the least restrictive environment to which he was entitled during the 2011-2012 school year?

SUMMARY:

The Student, at fouxteen year-old young man whose primary disability category is emotional disturbance,
attended the ACES Mill Road School (“School”) in North Haven until June 19, 2012. 111 the wake of a January
12, 2012 incident in which the Student was physically restrained by School personnel, the Student’s mother
(“Mother”) ﬁled a request for an impartial special education due process hearing. Claiming that School
personnel abused her son, the Mother maintains that the alleged abuse rendered the Student’s educational

placement inappropriate.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Request for Impartial Special Education Hearing, which was subsequently marked as Hearing Ofﬁcer’s
Exhibit—l, was received by the Board on March 21, 2012. It reads as follows:

Description of the nature of the issues in dispute, included related facts:
Staff members at the school are using physical force and abusing my child There’s a breakdown in

communication in speaking with school staff. 1 don’t trust them. I am vexy uncomfortable with my
child being forced to attend this school.

June 29, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0343

Proposed Resolution:

None on the school’s behalf. I proposed using alternative methods to achieve a desired result. I would
not consider corporal punishment or abuse ever.

The undersigned impartial special education hearing officer was appointed on March 20, 2012. On March 26,
2012, a prehearing conference took place. The Mother appeared on behalf of the Student. Typhanie Jackson,
Director of Student Sewices, appeared on behalf of the Board. The Mother stated that she objected to the
Student’s placement at the School. Ms. Jackson replied that the Board had provided and was providing the
Student a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment. Hearing dates were set for April
25, May 1 and May 10, 2012.

Attorney Michelle Laubin ﬁled an appearance as the Board’s legal representative on March 29, 2012. To allow
time for mediation, she requested a thirty-day extension and the cancellation of the April 25 and May 1 hearing
dates. The request was granted. N0 resolution was reached through mediation between the parties.

The hearing convened on May 10, 2012. In advance of the hearing, Attorney Laubin submitted exhibits
numbered B-l through B—44, which were entered as full exhibits. The Mother, who testiﬁed on behalf of the
Student, submitted one exhibit numbered P—1, which was entered as a full exhibit. Attorney Laubin agreed to
waive the ﬁve—day mle requiring exhibits to be introduced ﬁve or more days before a hearing date.

At the May 10 hearing, Attorney Laubin requested a 30-day extension in order to accommodate an additional
hearing date. The request for an extension was granted. In advance of the June 7, 2012 hearing date, Attorney
Laubin submitted exhibits numbered B—45 through B-49, which were entered as full exhibits. The Mother
submitted two additional exhibits. The hearing reconvened and adjourned on June 7, 2012. The ﬁnal decision

deadline is July 3,2012.
STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION:

In accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act and Connecticut General Statutes (“C.G.S.”)
§4— 1 76C through §4—178, this matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to 20 United States Code (“U.S.C.”)
§1415(i) and its related regulations and pursuant to C.G.S. §10-76h and its related regulations.

FINDINGS OF FACT:

1. The Student is fourteen years old and attended the School during the pendency of the due process
hearing.

2. It is undisputed that the Student is eligible for special education and related services under the categmy
of emotional disturbance. The Student has a complicated health history that includes cerebral palsy and
intensive physical and occupational therapy. He was formerly categorized as learning disabled (Exhs.
B-14, B-15)_

3. The Mother agreed to the categorization of the Student as emotionally disturbed not because she
believed him to be emotionally disturbed, but because she was told by Board personnel that such a
categorization would provide him access to counseling services. (Testimony of Mother.)

The Student has been described by school social workers and psychologists as charming, easily
distracted, and impulsive. (Exhs. B-S, B—31)

The Student has attended the School since December, 2010. Before that, he attended Jepsen School in
New Haven. (Testimony of Mother)

On January 12, 2012, a physical altercation occurred between the Student and Chris Smith, a School
Behavioral Technician who had given the Student a direction which the Student admits he purposely
ignored. (Exh. P—1, Testimony of Student)

Mr. Smith stated in a Behavior Incident Report signed by School Principal Erika Fotte (“Principal”) and
dated January 12, 2012 (“Repott”) that the Student “attempted to push through staff” after ignoring the
direction referred to in number 6, above. (Exh. P-1)

Mr. Smith stated in the Repott that the Student “became aggressive” after he attempted to escott the
Student to his destination. (Exh. P—l)

The Student was forcibly held against a wall for three minutes by Mr. Smith and another Behavioral
Technician and then forcibly held face—down against a wet ﬂoor for ﬁve minutes by Mr. Smith and two
Behavioral Technicians. (Exh. P—1, Testimony of Principal and Student)

The Repoﬂ contains two checklists of a1lowable protective holds. The three-minute hold is described
(checked) as the “2-Person Wall” hold. As for the ﬁve-minute ﬂoor hold that was used in this case, no
box is checked. The manner in which the Student was held — face-down by three people — does not
appear on the checklist. The only listed “3-Pet‘son Hold” contained in the checklist is “Face Up.” (Exh.
P-1)

The Student’s arms were twisted and held behind his back and his leg was bent upward. (Testimony of
Student)

The Student sought medical attention from the schoo1 nurse after the incident. (Exh. P-l, Testimony of
Principal)

The school nurse treated the Student for upper arm pain. (Exh. P-l, Testimony of Principal)

Due to the Mother’s concerns about the physical restraint used on the Student on January 12, 2012, the
Student did not attend the School for a period of approximately one month after January 12, 2012.
(Testimony of Mother)

At a February 7, 2012 PPT meeting in which the Mother expressed her disapproval of the physical
restraint employed in the January 12 incident, the patties failed to reach an agreement about the
Student’s educational program. The Principal then advised the Mother that she could request a special
education due process hearing. (Exh. B-44, Testimony of Mother and Principal)

In February, the Student informed his Mother that he wanted to return to the School in order to graduate
from the eighth grade. (Testimony of Mother and Student)

The Student returned to the School on or around February 26, 2012. (Testimony of Mother)

On March 19, 2012, the Mother submitted to the Connecticut Depaltment of Education a request for
impaltial special education hearing. (Exh. Hearing Ofﬁcer-l)

The Student wished to be removed from his educational placement at the School and returned to his
previous placement as a special education student at Jepsen School because he was unhappy about
having been physically restrained on January 12, 2012 and because he had more friends at his previous
school. (Testimony of Student)

The undersigned hearing ofﬁcer informed the Student that he would remain in his current placement
during the pendency of the hearing, in accordance with 20 United States Code §14150) (the “stay put”
provision) and the Regulations ofConnecticut State Agencies (“RCSA”) §10-76h-17(a).l

After the May 10, 2012 hearing, School personnel met with the Mother to agree on a “contract,” which
was to be implemented for the remainder of the school year. (Testimony of Principal)

On at least one occasion between May 10, 2012 and June 7, 2012, School personnel contacted the
Mother, who then traveled to the School, to 1‘ep011 a problem with the Student. (Testimony of Principal)

On at least one other occasion between May 10, 2012 and June 7, 2012 when there was a problem with
the Student, Schoo1 personnel contacted the Mother, who then spoke with the Student by telephone.
(Testimony of Principal)

The Student made academic and behavioral progress during the 201 1-2012 school year. (Testimony of
Mother, Student, Principal, Ms. Jackson, Exhs. B-40, 42, 44, 46, 47.)

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:

1.

The Student qualiﬁes for and is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”) in
the least restrictive environment (“LRE”), with special education and related services under the
provisions of state and federal laws. C.G.S. §§10—76 et seq. and the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Improvement Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1401, et seq., 34 C.F.R. Section 300.1(a), 34 C.F.R.
Section 300.17. The Student’s current primary special education category is emotional disturbance. 34
C.F.R. Section 300.8(c)(4).

‘RCSA §10—76h~17(a). Educational placement during proceedings provides: “Unless the public agency and
the parent agree otherwise, the child shall remain in his or her then—cun‘ent educational placement during the
pendency of any administrative or judicial proceedings regarding issues set forth in Section 10-76h-3 0f the
Regulations.”

June 29, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12-0343

2.

The standard for determining whether FAPE in the LRE has been provided is set forth in Board of
Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982). The two-
pi'onged inquiry is ﬁrst, whether the procedural requirements of IDEA have been met. Id at 206.
Procedures required by the IDEA include an opportunity for the parents of a student with a disability to
examine all records relating to such student and to participate in meetings with respect to the
identiﬁcation, evaluation, and educational placement of the student, and the provision of a free
appropriate public education to the student, and to obtain an independent educational evaluation of the
student. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1); see also Cerra v. Pawling Cent. Sch. Dist, 427 F.3d 186, 192 (2d Cir.
2005). In this case, it is the delivery of the Student’s educational program, not a required procedure, that
IS at issue.

The second, more substantive prong 0f Rowley addresses whether a student’s IEP has been “reasonably
calculated to enable the child to receive educational beneﬁts.” Rowley, 458 US 176, 206~207 (1982).
The requirement of FAPE is satisﬁed by “providing personalized instruction with sufﬁcient support
services to permit the child to beneﬁt educationally from that instruction.” Id, at 203. “[A] school
district fulﬁlls its substantive obligations under the IDEA if it provides an IEP that is likely to produce
progress, not regression, and if the IEP affords the student an opportunity greater than mere trivial
advancement.” Cerra, 427 F.3d at 195 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The requirement of FAPE is determined in light of state statutes and regulations. As the IDEA’S
deﬁnition of a FAPE makes clear, “[t]he Act does not usurp the state’s traditional role in setting
educational policy.” Taylor V. Vt. Dep’l 0fEduc., 313 F.3d 768, 777 (2d Cir. 2002); 20 U.S.C. §1402
(9). “The statute incorporates state substantive standards as the governing federal mie if they are
consistent with the federal scheme and meet the minimum requirements set forth by the IDEA.” 1d.
(Internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

The Board has the burden of proving the appropriateness of the child’s program or placement, which
burden shall be met by a preponderance of evidence. Regulations of Connecticut Agencies (“RCSA”)
§10-76h-14(a).

As the party who requested the due process hearing, the Mother carries the burden of going forward with
the evidence. RCSA §10-76h-14(a).

C.G.S. §46a—1 52 (a) provides, in relevant part: “No provider or assistant may use involuntary physical
restraint on a person at risk2 except . . . as an emergency intervention to prevent immediate or imminent
injury to the person at risk 01' to others, provided the restraint is not used for discipline or convenience
and is not used as a substitute for a less restrictive alternative.”

C.G.S. §46a-152 (b) provides, in relevant part: “Each local or regional board of education, institution or
facility providing special education for a child shall notify the parent or guardian ofeach incident in
which such child is placed in physical restrain 0r seclusion.”

RCSA §10-76b-6 provides: “Use of physical restraint and seclusion in public schools. N0 provider or
assistant shall (1) use involuntaiy physical restraint on a person at risk 01' (2) involuntarily place a person

2A ‘person at risk’ includes a child requiring special education. C.G.S. § 46a—150 (3).

at risk in seclusion, unless such use conforms to the requirements of sections 4621-150 to 46a-154,
inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, and the requirements of sections 10—76b-5 to 10-76b-1 1,
inclusive, of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.”

The Student testiﬁed credibly that he did not attempt to push anyone, but that he used his arms
defensively after Mr. Smith touched him. (Testimony of Student)

The Student testiﬁed credibly that he was surprised when he was then thrown up against a glass wall, at
which point his arms were twisted behind his back, and that he was then restrained against the ﬂoor, at
which point his leg was bent behind him. (Testimony of Student)

The Board presented no evidence that Mr. Smith attempted a less restrictive alternative, as required by
CTG.S. §46a—152 (a), to direct the Student to his proper destination aﬂer the Student resisted being
escoited. Mr. Smith’s written statement in the Report that the Student attempted to push through staff
and behaved aggressively, even if true, does not evince the requisite emergency or threat of immediate
or imminent injuiy required by statute. Rather, the physical restraint utilized on January 12, 2012 was
improperiy used as a diseiplinaly measure, which C.G.S. § 46a-152 (a) explicitly prohibits. Moreover,
the manner in which the Student was held face-down by three people does not appear on the School’s
checklist of permissible holds. Based on the facts as presented, the use of physical restraint on the
Student by School personnel on January 12, 2012 was improper. The Board thus failed to conform with
RCSA §10-76b-6. (Exh. P-l)

The failure of a Board to address the improper physical restraint of a student constitutes a denial of
FAPE in the LRB in cases where a preponderance of evidence demonstrates that such physical restraint
substantially interfered with the student’s ability to obtain meaningful educational beneﬁts. Houston
Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Bobby R., 200 F.3d 341, 349 (5th Cir. 2000); TR. ex rel. NR. Vi Kingwood Twp, Bd.
0fEduc., 205 F.3d 572, 577-78 (3d Cir. 2000); EH. V. West Clermom Bd. quduc., 788 F.Supp.2d 682
(SD. Ohio 2011).

In B.H. v. West Clermont Bd, ofEduc., 788 F.Supp.2d 682 (SD. Ohio 2011), for example, the district
coult upheld a hearing ofﬁcer’s conclusion that the district denied the student FAPE in the LRE, partly
due to the fact that the student was repeatedly physically restrained by school staff. “The Court ﬁnds
that Defendant failed to meet B’s behavioral needs where it neglected to implement appropriate positive
behavioral interventions, set increasingly 10w behavioral expectations, and employed physical restraint,
even where shown to be ineffective.” Id. at 699.

This case is distinguishable from B.H. v. West Clermom Bd, of Educ. in several ways. First, in this case,
the complained~ofrestraint occurred once or twice, not frequently.3 Second, whereas the student in West
Clermont regressed during the school year in question, the Student in this case, by all accounts, has
made progress throughout the school year. Additionally, the physical restraint at issue was properly
documented and repoﬁed to the Mother. Finally, School personnel attempted to avoid additional
incidents of physical restraint of the Student by twice contacting the Mother when problems arose.

(Exh. P-l , Findings of Fact 21, 22, 23, 24, Testimony of Student, Mother, Principal)

3During the second day of hearing, the mother stated that the Mr. Smith again “put his hands on my son.”

The Board in this case demonstrated by a preponderance of evidence, including IEPs and report cards,
that it provided the Student with signiﬁcant educational beneﬁts during the 2011-2012 school year. The
Student’s grades improved over the course of the year. Additionally, the Student was named Student of
the Quatter and made good progress in the School’s “Point Sheet System” of motivationaI management.
(Exhs. B-40, 42, 44, 46, 47, Finding of Fact 24, Testimony of Ms. Jackson)

In this case, the improper physical restraint did not substantially interfere with the Student’s ability to
obtain meaningful educational beneﬁts for the 201 1-2012 school year. Accordingly, the improper
physical restraint did not result in a denial of FAPE in the LRE.

A hearing ofﬁcer’s authority to issue orders is conﬁned to instances in which FAPE in the LRE has been
denied. “The touchstone of a traditional tort—like remedy is redress for a broad range of harms
associated with personal injury, such as pain and suffering, emotional distress, harm to reputation, 01'
other consequential damages. United States v. Burke, 504 US. 229, 239 (1992) , . . By contrast, the
touchstone of IDEA is the actual provision of a free appropriate public education.” (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) Sellers v. School Board of the City of Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 527 (4th Cir. 1998).

Regarding improper uses of physical restraint, a patty may look beyond the realm of the special
education due process hearing. “The remedial scheme of the IDEA is not ‘so comprehensive that there
is an implication that it provides the exclusive remedy foreclosing all other remedies,”’ MH. v. Bristol
Bd. ofEduct, 169 F.Supp.2d 21 (D. Conn. 2001), quoting Mrs W v. Tirozzi, 832 F.2d 748, 754 (2d Cir.
1987).

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

1.

2.

The use of physical restraint by School personnel on the Student did not result in a denial of FAPE in the
LRE to which the Student was entitled during the 2011-2012 school year.

The Board provided the Student at FAPE in the LRE for the 2011-2012 school year.
