conference convened on January 16, 2013. At the ﬁrst preheating conference, the Board was not
present, so a second preheating conference was scheduled. A second prehearing conference
convened on January 24, 2013 with the Parent and the Board’s attorney present. A resolution
session was convened on January 22, 2013 and at the preheating conference both palties
indicated that they would agree to a mediation session if the matter was not resolved through the

resolution session.
The Parent submitted notiﬁcation which was received on January 28, 2013 that a resolution had

been formulated and agreed upon and, therefore, the Parent was requesting a dismissal of the due
process hearing request. Therefore, this matter is dismissed.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED.
