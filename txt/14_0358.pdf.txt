the Student’s difﬁculties are due to non-educational issues. The Student was found 504 eligible
and accommodations would be provided. The Parent agreed with this determination. (P-6)

At the December 1, 2011 PPT meeting, the Student was found eligible to receive special
education and related services under the identiﬁcation category of Emotional Disturbance. At
the time, the Student was committed to DCF and had been placed at The Children’s Center in
Hamden, Connecticut where she was receiving her educational program. The Student was
doing well academically. DCF planned to transfer the Student to the New Hope Manor Group
Home and have her receive her educational program at The Summit Academy. (NB-S,
Testimony of DCF Treatment Worker)

The Student refused to participate in a psychoeducational evaluation performed in December
2011. A prior evaluation conducted in 2008, showed that the Student had a full scale IQ of 111.
Behavioral rating scales indicated concerns in attention problems, oppositional behavior and
depression and anxiety. (P—8)

On April 12, 2012, the Student was discharged from The Children’s Center in Hamden,
Connecticut. The Student’s grades at the time of discharge were in the 80 to 91 range. The
teachers stated that the Student worked independently, displayed appropriate behavior,
interacted appropriately with teachers, worked in an organized manner and demonstrated good
efforts in class. (NB—8)

On April 12, 2012, the Student was transferred by DCF to Journey House in Mansﬁeld,
Connecticut, which is part of Natchaug Hospital. The Student’s grades in the last quarter of her
junior year ware all As. (NB-9)

The Student turned 18 years old at the end of the 2012-2013 school year. The Student’s rights
under IDEA transferred to her on her birthdate. (P-l)

The Student was under the Department of Children and F amilies (DCF) guardianship from
2010 until her 18Lh birthday. At the termination of the DCF guardianship, the Student agreed to
a voluntary commitment with DCF. (P—17, Testimony of DCF Treatment Worker)

On July 29, 2013, the Student signed a Surrogate Parent Service form and assigned the
Surrogate her right to review and request educational records, advocate in all educational
matters on her behalf, consent to evaluations and advise her regarding educational matters. (P-
28)

The Student’s 2012-2013 Individualized Education Program (IEP) showed that she was making
progress in her three transitional goals and her behavioral goal. The Surrogate Parent did not
object that the goals and objectives were not properly drafted nor raise any issues that the
Student was not making satisfactory progress. (N B—1 6)

At the January 14, 2013 and the June 17, 2013 PPT meetings, the PPT team discussed the
Student’s graduation. The Student had earned more than the required 20 credits to graduate.

The Student’s Surrogate was present at the January 14, 2013 and the June 17, 2013 PPTs. At
the June 17, 2013 PPT, the Surrogate requested an extension of her IEP. The District conﬁrmed
that the Student would graduate. At this time the Surrogate was acting without the written
authority of the Student. The Student was over the age of eighteen and did not sign a Surrogate
Parent Service Agreement until July 29, 2103. The Surrogate had not spoken with the Student
about her graduation. (NB—17, P—1, P-2, P-28, Testimony of Surrogate Parent)

The Educational Director of Journey House, the Student’s educational placement, participated
at the June 17, 2103 PPT meeting by telephone. The Director stated that the Student was
making reasonable progress in her placement. She did not object to the Student receiving her
diploma and being graduated. Based on the information received from Journey House, the
Student was making progress on her goals and objectives. (Testimony ofNorwalk Assistant
Director (NAD))

The Surrogate did not agree that the student had earned enough credits to graduate. This was
based on discrepancies regarding credits awarded June 2010, during her freshman year. At that
time, the Student was in a DCF placement at The Children’s Center. The Surrogate testiﬁed
that prior to the June 17, 2013 PPT, he did not have any concerns about the Student’s
educational progress. (Testimony of Surrogate Parent)

On J une 27, 2013, the State of Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction
Services (“DMHAS”) placed the Student at JRI Meadow Ridge, a facility in Swansea,
Massachusetts. This placement was determined by DCF, not at a PPT meeting. (Testimony of
DCF Social Worker)

DMHAS would assume the responsibility for the Student’s placement at Meadowridge upon
the issuance of her diploma. The Student’s Surrogate testiﬁed that he would provide
Meadowridge with the Student’s diploma. (Testimony of DCF Social Worker, Testimony of
Surrogate Parent)

The Principal of Meadowridge testiﬁed that DCF had informed him that the Student had
graduated. The Student told the principal that she thought she had graduated. The Student’s
placement was for medical needs. The Student’s placement was a psychiatric placement and
not based on educational needs. An estimate of when the Student would be exited could not be
given. (Testimony of Principal of Meadowridge)

The Principal of Meadowridge opined that DMHAS would be responsible for the placement
upon the receipt of her high school diploma. (Testimony of Principal of Meadowridge)

On March 27, 2014, DCF sent Bridgeport Board of Education a form informing the Board that
the Student’s mother had moved to Bridgeport in October 2013 and that the Bridgeport Public
Schools was the Student’s nexus. (BB—3)

The Parent did not make an effort to enroll the Student in the Bridgeport Public Schools. The
Surrogate requested a PPT; this was denied because the Student had graduated from Norwalk
High School. The Bridgeport Board made efforts to ascertain the Parent’s residency in
Bridgeport. Board employees went to the address provided by DCF but no one was present at
the address. (Testimony of Bridgeport Special Education Supewisor)

21. The Sun'ogate was informed of his rights to object to the Bridgeport Board of Education denial

of the request for a PPT. The Surrogate did not challenge the denial. There was no attempt to
register the Student in the Bridgeport Public Schools. (Testimony of Surrogate Parent)

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW and ARGUMENT:

1.

It is undisputed that the Student is eligible for special education and related services as set forth
in IDEA, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1401, et seq. FAPE is deﬁned as special education and related services
that are provided at public expense, meet the standards of the state educational agency, include

an appropriate education, and that are provided in conformity with the IEP. 20 U.S.C.§1401(8).

Once a Board has identiﬁed a child as eligible for IDEA services, it must create and implement
an IEP based on the student‘s needs and areas of disabi1ity. Boards are not, however, required to
“maximize the potential” of each handicapped student. Bd. of Educ. Of Hendrick Hudson Cent.
Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 US. 176, 197 n. 21 (1982)). Instead, to satisfy the IDEA, the Board
must offer an IEP that is “reasonably calcu1ated”t0 enable the child to receive “meaningful”
educational beneﬁt in light of the student's intellectual potential. I~d._at 206-207. Once the Board
has designed and administered an IEP that is reasonably calculated to enable the receipt of
meaningful educational beneﬁt, it has satisﬁed its obligation to provide the child with FAPE.

If the Parent or the Student is not satisﬁed or that the program will not provide FAPE, they can
challenge the educational placement. 34 C.F.R. §300.507(a)(1). It is the Board’s responsibility
ofproving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the appropriateness of the program and
placement it has provided to the Student. Conn. Gen. Stat. (CGS) §10-76h-14(a).

The standard for determining whether a Board has provided a free appropriate public education
is set fmth as a two—pait inquiry in Rowley. It must ﬁrst be determined whether the Board
complied with the procedural requirements of IDEA. The second inquiry is a determination of
whether the IEP is “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.”
I_d. at 206-207.

The Surrogate Parent alleges that the Norwalk Board committed a procedural vio1ation by not
informing him of the Student’s graduation. The Noiwalk Board had no obligation to give notice
to the Surrogate of the Student’s pending graduation. At the time of the exit PPT, the Surrogate
did not have the authority to represent the Student (Findings of F act No. 12). The Surrogate had
been present at the prior PPT, January 14, 2013, at which the PPT team was recommending
graduating the Student on June 2013. Even though the Surrogate states that he did not have
notice, he was present at the June 17, 2013 PPT where the only recommendation was the
graduation of the Student. (Findings of Fact N0. 12) The Surrogate had a copy of the Student’s
diploma. (Findings of F act No. 16) The Student was aware she had graduated. (F indings of Fact
No. 17). The NorwaIk Board did not commit a procedural violation.

The second inquiry of the Rowley test speciﬁcally addresses whether the respective Student’s
IEP provided FAPE. Appropriateness is determined by focusing on what was or was not,
objectively reasonable when a snapshot of the IEP was taken. DP. and DR on behalf ofN.F.
v. Rampo Central School District, 403 F3d. 595 (2d. Circuit 2005).

The Board fulﬁlls its obligation under the second inquiry if it provides an lEP that is “likely to
produce progress, not regression,” and if the IEP affords the Student with an opportunity
greater than “trivial advancement.” Walczak v. Florida Union Free School District, 142 F.3d at
130.

The Student was making satisfactory progress in her IEP goals and objectives for the 2012~
2013 school year. The Educational Director of the Student’s placement testiﬁed that the
Student was making reasonable progress and was not opposed to her getting her diploma. The
Surrogate Parent did not have any concerns about the Student’s educational progress. (F indings
of Fact Nos. 10 and 14).

Connecticut General Statutes Section 10—221a(a) provides that for classes graduating high
school from 2004 to 2019, inclusive, no local or regional board of education shall permit any
student to graduate from high school or grant a diploma to any student who has not
satisfactorily completed a minimum of twenty credits, not fewer than four of which shall be in
English, not fewer than three in mathematics, not fewer than three in social studies, including at
least a one—half credit course on civics and American govemment, not fewer than two in
science, not fewer than one in the arts or vocational education and not fewer than one in
physical education. The Student had fulﬁlled the credit requirements to graduate. (Finding of
Fact No. 11) The Student was properly graduated at the end of the 2012-2013 school year.

DCF ﬁled F onn 603 on March 27, 2014, giving the Bridgeport Board of Education notice that
in October 2013, the Student’s Parent had moved to Bridgeport making Bridgeport Public
Schools the Student’s nexus. (Finding of Fact Nos. 19 and 20) Since the Student was properly
graduated at the end of the 2012—201 3 school year, Bridgeport has no FAPE obligations to the
Student. The IDEA regulations state that the obligation to make FAPE available to all children
with disabilities does not apply with respect to students with disabilities who have graduated
from high school with a regular high school diploma. §300.102 (a) The obligation to make
FAPE available to all children with disabilities does not apply with respect to the following:
(3)0) Children with disabilities who have graduated from high school with a regular high
school diploma.

To the extent a procedural claim raised by the Surrogate Parent is not speciﬁcally addressed
herein, the Hearing Ofﬁcer has concluded that the claim lacked merit.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

1. The Student was properly graduated at the end of the 2012-2013 school year.

2. Since the Student was properly graduated, the Norwalk Board of Education does not have to pay for
the Student’s placement at Meadowridge.

3‘ Since the Student was properly graduated, the Norwalk Board of Education does not have to
provide a transition plan for the 2013-2014 school year.

4. Since the Student was properly graduated, the Noxwalk Board of Education does not have to
provide an extended school year program for the summer of 2013.

5. Since the Student was properly graduated, the Norwalk Board of Education does not have to offer a
program for the 2013-2014.

 

If the local or regional board of education 01' the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either patty in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A)A
