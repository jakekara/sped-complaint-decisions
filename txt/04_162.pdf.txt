Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:    1.  Whether the Student&#8482;s behavior which resulted in the pending expulsion proceeding 
was a manifestation of the Student&#8482;s disability. 
 2.  If so, whether the Student&#8482;s IEP must be revised. 
 SUMMARY:  The matter was assigned on June 14, and a prehearing conference was held on 
June 17.  At the prehearing, counsel for both parties agreed to limit their case 
presentation to two days each.  The hearing was scheduled to be held on July 8, July 12, July 13 and July 14 for this expedited hearing.  At the prehearing conference, the Parents&#8482; 
attorney indicated that the Parents&#8482; case would conclude on July 12, and the Board would proceed on July 13 and July 14.    On July 6, the Parents&#8482; attorney submitted a lengthy correspondence which was 
construed as a motion that the Board present its case first, on July 8.  The Board filed a 

memorandum opposing this motion.  This motion from the Parents&#8482; attorney contradicted 
what was set forth during the prehearing conference, and was submitted on the eve of the 

hearing.
