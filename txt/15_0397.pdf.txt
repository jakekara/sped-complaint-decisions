PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On February 27, 2015, the New Fairﬁeld Board of Education received Student’s Request for a Special
Education Due Process Hearing and the undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on March 10, 2015.
During the prehearing conference held on March 18, 2015, hearing dates of April 30, 2015 and May 19,
2015 were set and the deadline for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was established as May
13, 2015. On April 22, 2015, Counsel for the Parents requested a postponement of the April 30, 2015
hearing date and an extension of the existing mailing deadline in order to permit the parties time to
ﬁnalize a settlement agreement. The Board joined in these requests and both requests were granted.
The new deadline for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was estab1ished as June 12, 2015. On
May 7, 2015, Attorney for the Parent sent an email to the Hearing Ofﬁcer indicating the matter had
settled and Parents were withdrawing their hearing request.

In light of the above facts, the case is dismissed.

providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take

receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the healing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
