FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
Issues:

1. Are the evaluations conducted by the Board (or it’s Agents) of the Student comprehensive, valid and
appropriate for this Student?
2. Was the Board’s denial of the parental request for an Independent Educational Evaluation

appropriate?

Procedural History:

This matter is before the Hearing Ofﬁcer pursuant to a Request for Due Process hearing, filed by the
Bloomﬁeld Board ofEducation (“Board”), received by the Parent on May 5, 2012 and identiﬁed as Case
No. 12—03 99. No preheating conference was held as the parties reached resolution prior to the
scheduling of the conference. The issues for the due process hearing were identiﬁed on the Due Process
hearing request. The Board stated on the complaint that they were seeking to utilize the mediation
process to attempt to resolve the issues. Mediation was held on May 15, 2012. On May 17, 2012

counsel for the Board indicated via email that mediation had been successful and the matter had been

settled. The Board then withdrew the request for Due Process.

Final Decision and Order:

It is therefore ordered that pursuant to the request by the Board to withdraw their request for a Due

Process hearing, and with no further issues pending, this matter is dismissed without prejudice.
