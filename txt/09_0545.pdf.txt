nded complaint and did so on August 26, 2009. A pre-
hearing conference was scheduled for September 16, 2009. Prior to the pre-he
aring conference, the parties resolved the matter. The Student with
drew the request for hearing with prejudice. FINAL DECISION AND ORDER In light of the above facts, the above-captioned case is hereby dismissed with prejudice.
