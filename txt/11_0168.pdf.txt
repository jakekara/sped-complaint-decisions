FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
A special education hearing in the above-captione
d matter was requested by the Board of Education 
(&#64257;BOE&#64258;) via letter dated October18, 2010.1 It was received by Student&#8482;s Mother on October 20. Therefore, the thirty-day resolution period ran through November
 19 and the deadline for mailing the final decision 
and order is January 3, 2011. The following issues are identified from the request for hearing: 
1.Are BOE&#8482;s recent evaluations of Student appropriate? 
2.If the answer to issue one above is &#64257;no&#64258;, is Student entitled to an independent educational evaluation at public expense? A pre-hearing conference was scheduled for November 10. Neither BOE&#8482;s Attorney nor Student&#8482;s 
Mother appeared. The Hearing Officer issued a Me
morandum to the Parties and Orders on November 10 
indicating that, upon the request of either party, another pre-hearing conference would be scheduled and gave the parties a deadline to indicate their availability for hear
ing on certain enumerated dates. 
Student&#8482;s Mother responded indicating that she misunderstood the 
pre-hearing conference notice and thought that someone would call he
r and did not understand that she had to call into the conference call service. Student&#8482;s Mother further indicated that, 
if BOE intends to move forward, she would like to 
schedule another pre-hearing conference. BOE&#8482;s Attorney did not respond to the Orders, which also indicated that &#64257;If a party does not respond with their availability by November 15, the Hearing Officer will assume that all such dates are acceptable 
and will schedule the hearing accordingly.&#64258; 
BOE&#8482;s Attorney did not indicate availability for hearing, did not respond to the notice that she missed the pre-hearing conference, 
and did not respond to Student&#8482;s Mother&#8482;s e-mail inquiring as to 
1 All dates are 2010 unless otherwise indicated.
