schedules and the impending holidays and this was granted.

dates were added at the request of the parties so that the hearing was scheduled to proceed on January 7, 2005, February 8, 2005 and February 10, 2005.

December 30, 2004.  Subsequently the parties advised that the matter had been resolved. 
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The hearing is dismissed.
