Section 1401 et seq. The parents requested a due process hearing alleging that the program offered by the Board was not appropriate and that the student needed a residential placement.   On August 21, 2001 a 30 day extension was granted to the parties in order for the parties to try and mediate the matter. The case was scheduled for a hearing on October 5, 2001. At the October 5, 2001 hearing date the parties asked for a delay to the start of the hearing in order to have the parties memorialize an agreement. The hearing was started and the parent&#8482;s through their attorney withdrew their request for a due process hearing. The parties were canvassed that they were in agreement for the hearing request to be withdrawn with prejudice. The hearing was then dismissed with prejudice.   To the extent the summary of facts and finding of facts actually represent conclusions of law, they should be so considered and visa versa.
