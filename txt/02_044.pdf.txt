West Haven Board of Education     Appearing on behalf of the Parents:  Attorney Jennifer Laviano 77 Danbury Road, Suite C-6  Ridgefield, CT  06877  Appearing on behalf of the Board: Attorney Michelle Laubin Berchem, Moses & Devlin  75 Broad Street Milford, CT  06460  Appearing before: Attorney Mary Elizabeth Oppenheim, Hearing Officer   ISSUE:  Whether the placement of the Students at Connecticut Center for Child Development for the 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 school years is appropriate.  PROCEDURAL SUMMARY:  This hearing was requested on February 19, 2002.  The prehearing conference was held on February 25.  The hearing was held on March 25.  This hearing proceeded as a consolidated action at the request of the Parents on behalf of their twins.  Absent objection from the Board, and because this was the most efficient manner for the matter to proceed as the witnesses were identical for both of the Students, the matter was heard as a consolidated case.  The Mother and Janet Calabro of Connecticut Center for Child Development appeared as witnesses on behalf of the Parents.  Billie Ladd, the Board&#8482;s Director of Pupil Services was the sole witness on behalf of the Board.   To the extent that the summary and findings of fact actually represent conclusions of law, they should be so considered, and vice versa. Bonnie Ann F. v. Callallen Independent School Board, 835 F. Supp. 340 (S.D.Tex. 1993).
