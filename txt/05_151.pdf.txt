   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  1. Does the Norwalk Board of Education have the right to transfer the student to a 
different school in the district? 
 SUMMARY:  The Student is a fourteen year old multidisabled 
student.  Pursuant to P.J. et al. v. State of 
Connecticut, State Board of Education et al. 2:91CV00180 (RNC) the Board sought, for the 2005-2006 school year, to move the student to a middle school other than the one the 
student had been attending.  The parent opposed the move and filed for due process.  The 
Board filed a Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The parent 
opposed the Motion to Dismiss in writing, citing what amounted to a number of facts that 
were in dispute.  The Motion to Dismiss was denied.  The hearing convened on July 27, 

2005 and was completed on that day.  
 This Final Decision and Order sets forth the Hearing Officer&#8482;s findings of fact and conclusions of law.  To the extent that findings of fact actually represent conclusions of law, they should be so considered, and vice versa.  For reference, see SAS Institute Inc. v. S&H Computer Systems, Inc., 605 F. Supp. 816, (March 6, 1985) and Bonnie Ann F. v. Callallen Independent School District, 835 F.Supp.340 (S.D.Tex. 1993).
