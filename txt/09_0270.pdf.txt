 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 ISSUES:  1. Is the Board entitled to conduct its own ev
aluations of the Student in response to the Parents&#8482; request to identify the Stude
nt as eligible for special education? 
 2. If not, are the Parents entitled to an i
ndependent educational evaluation of the Student at Board expense? 
  
PROCEDURAL HISTORY:    The Board&#8482;s Director of Student Services 
requested this hearing on December 22, 2008 
by faxing a letter to the State Department of Education (SDE) and 
copies to the Parents and the 
Board&#8482;s attorney. This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on December 24, 2008. On 
January 5, 2009, the Board&#8482;s attorney filed an appearance. A prehearing conference was held on 
January 7, 2009 with the Board&#8482;s attorney and the Mother. The mailing date of the final decision 

was established as February 5, 2009. Hearing dates were agreed on for January 28, 2009 and January 29, 2009 and February 3, 2009. On January 
15, 2009, the Parents requested that the issue of the Student&#8482;s eligibility for special education be added to 
the Board&#8482;s pending due process request. On January 16, 2009, the Bo
ard&#8482;s attorney objected to adding the issue because it should be raised by the Parents in a separate due process case. The Parents&#8482; 
request was denied. On January 20, 2009, the Board&#8482;s attorney requested a postponement of the three hearing dates so 
that the parties could schedule mediation on one of
 those dates, an extension of the mailing date 
of the final decision and a second prehearing conference if the parties did not resolve the case at mediation. The request was granted, a new hear
ing date was scheduled for February 17, 2009, the mailing date for the final decision was ex
tended to March 9, 2009, and a second prehearing conference was scheduled on February 5, 2009.   1
