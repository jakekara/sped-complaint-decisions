 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  (September 24, 2008) 
 This matter was commenced by request 
for due process dated August 11, 2008 on behalf of the Student, who is over 18 years of age, by her parents (the &#64257;Parents&#64258;).  The Board advised that it had received the due process complaint on August 13, 2008.  The 
Board did not challenge the sufficiency of
 the complaint and filed an answer on 
September 5, 2008.  
 
By agreement of the parties, a tele
phonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) convened on September 4, 2008.  Mr. Cohn partic
ipated on behalf of the Student and Ms. Laubin on behalf of the Board.  Among other things, the parties at the PHC reported that 
a resolution session had been scheduled and that should the dispute remain unresolved 

following the resolution session, the parties had agreed to participate in a Connecticut Department of Education (&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;)-sponsor
ed mediation scheduled for September 17, 
2008.  To permit the parties an opportunity to 
resolve this matter by agreement while also 

allowing this matter to be resolved expe
ditiously should settlement efforts prove 
unsuccessful, an initial scheduling order was issued on September 8, 2008.  By agreement, that order identified (subject 
to modification) October 7 and 15, 2008 as 
potential hearing dates and October 27, 2008 as the date for the mailing of the Final 
Decision and Order, and scheduled a follow-up PHC for September 19, 2008 as 
necessary.  The parties thereafter timely reported that they
 had reached and executed an agreement resolving their dispute through th
e CTDOE-sponsored mediation and that the 
due process hearing request was being withdrawn with prejudice by agreement.     
 
Accordingly, this matter is hereby DISM
ISSED.  The parties are commended for 
their attention to this matter
 and their diligence in worki
ng to resolve their dispute.
