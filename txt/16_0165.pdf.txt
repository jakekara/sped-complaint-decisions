July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0165

To the extent that the procedural history, summary, and ﬁndings of fact actually represent conclusions of
law, they should be so considered, and vice versa. For reference, see SAS Institute Inc. v. H Compuler
Systems, Inc, 605 F.Supp. 816 (MD. Tenn. 1985) and Bonnie Am: F. v. Calallen Independent School
District, 835 F.Supp. 340, 20 IDELR 736 (SD. Tex. 1993).

SUMMARY:

The Student, who was born on December 29, 2001, is eligible for special education under the category
of Other Health Impairment — ADHD. Student has executive functioning deﬁcits, which negatively
impact her organization and writing output. Student also suffers from anxiety which exacerbates her
executive functioning deﬁcits. While the District provided an appropriate program for her seventh and
eighth grade year, the proposed program for the transition to high school did not contain sufﬁcient
therapeutic sewices to support Student, who struggled with transitions within the school day, in her
transition to high school.

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes (C.G.S.) §10-76h
and related regulations, 20 United States Code §1415(t) and related regulations, and in accordance with
the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (U.A.P.A.), C.G.S. §§4-176e to 4—178, inclusive, §§4-1 81a
and 4-186.

FINDINGS OF FACT:

After considering all the evidence submitted by the Parties, including documentary evidence and
testimony of witnesses, I ﬁnd the following facts:

Background, 504 Accommodations and Identification under IDEA

1. Student was born on December 29, 2001, which was a little over two months before her
scheduled due date and as a result of her premature birth, Student spent 29 days in the neonatal
intensive care unit. (Testimony of Mother) Student’s disabilities have been attributed at least in some
part to Student’s premature birth and apnea during her perinatal period. (B-4,B-88)

2. Student’s parents divorced when Student was 4 years old and Student resides primarily with
Mother and alternates spending 4 day weekends with Father. (Testimony of Mother; B—88)

3. While in Kindergarten, Student was diagnosed with Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder —
Predominantly lnattentive Type by Dr. Christine McCarthy, a neuropsychologist. (B—4) In her May
2007 report, Dr. McCaithy also identiﬁed student as having a Superior Full Scale IQ, having scored
in the 95th percentile 0n the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI—III). (1d,)
Dr. McCaithy recommended individual tutoring over the summer and consultation with a child
psychiatrist, with the goals of teaching student strategies for managing and expressing anxieties, to
determine whether medical treatment was warranted, and to monitor medical treatment if Parents

3

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0165

elected to pursue this. (Id.)

4. Subsequent testing by Dr. McCaithy a few months later revealed signiﬁcant improvements in
attentional focus with anxiety noted to be the primary concern due to emotional distress observed
when Student was asked to write her name and the alphabet. (B-7) F allow up in ﬁrst grade showed
Student remained in the at—risk category. (B—9)

5. During second grade Student was given accommodations under Section 504 of the Americans
with Disabilities Act. Student’s 504 accommodations were modiﬁed as necessary over the years
leading up to Student’s identiﬁcation. (B-31, B-3 8, B-43, B—61)

6. At a PPT meeting held on June 1, 2012, Student was found eligible for special education and
related services under the category of Other Health Impaiiment-Attention Deﬁcit Disorder and
Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (“OHI—ADD/ADHD”). (B—69)

Student’s Medical Needs

7. Student was diagnosed with severe scoliosis when she was 5 years old. (Testimony of Mother;
B—30) Initially Student’s treatment involved wearing a back brace from age 5 to age 10. (Testimony
of Mother) At age 10, it was determined that Student required surgical inteivention and during the
summer between Student’s ﬁfth and sixth grade year, Student had spinal fusion surgery. (Id.)
Despite undergoing this surgery in the July following her ﬁfth grade year, Student was able to begin
sixth grade at the Roger Ludlowe Middle School in F airﬁeld at the same time as the other students.
(Id.)

8. From the time of the surgery to the present, Student’s surgeon has set speciﬁc physical
limitations which protect her spine. (Testimony of Mother) Speciﬁcally, she cannot carry weight
over an amount speciﬁed by the doctor and is prohibited from wearing a backpack, and so Student
was permitted to use a wheeled backpack. (Testimony of Mother; B-92) This backpack did not ﬁt
into the middle school lockers. (1d.) District staff had ongoing communications with Mother
regarding Student’s limitations as they pertained to activities Student might be asked to participate in
and Student’s needs were accommodated. (B-93, B-96, B—105, B—113, B—1 15 and B—117)Although
the educational consultant hired by Parents stated the District was unable to meet Student’s physical
needs because the school was physically too large, no documentation from a doctor was provided to
support this claim. (Testimony of Educational Consultant, p. 94)

9. Parents arranged for Student to receive treatment with medication for her attentional issues and
made adjustments to medication over time. (B—40, B—66, B—88) Medication was subsequently
discontinued by Parents and was not being utilized by the time period that is the subject of this
hearing. (Testimony of Mother; B-88)

Evaluations

10. At the request of Parents, the PPT met on March 5, 2012, Student’s ﬁfth grade year, and agreed
to have Dr. Timothy Heitzman conduct a neuropsychological evaluation, which was paid for by the
District. (B-73, B-78, B—82) An occupational therapy motor screening and consult with a teacher of
the visually impaired were also recommended and completed. (B-78, B—83, 8—85)

4

 

July 21 , 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0 165

11. Dr. Heitzman confirmed Student’s previous diagnosis of ADHD-Predominately Inattentive
Type, and noted behaviors that met the criteria for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (“0CD”) but
which he identiﬁed could be, along with Student’s recent decline in functioning, attributed to
Student’s medication. (B-88, p. 8) Student’s executive dysfunction is speciﬁcally linked with
Student’s limited ability to regulate focus and inhibit distractions, which manifests itself in difﬁculty
shifting attention in a ﬂuid manner. (B—88, p. 8) Student’s anxiety exacerbates her executive
functioning dysfunction. (1d) Student’s full scale 1Q could not be determined by Dr. Heitzman due
to discrepancies between the score on the processing speed composite amid the other three
composite scores on verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, and working memory. (B—88, p.
12) Student has well below average processing speed and low average working memory. (Testimony
of Dr. Heitzman, p. 103; B-88 p.5)

12. In 2012, Student’s academic achievement fell in the average range for reading and within the
average to high average for math, while Student’s spelling was at the low end of the average range,
her handwriting was characterized by poor spatial orientation and her writing showed little verbal
organization in her written expression. (B-88)

13. Student’s writing difﬁculties ﬂow from her executive functioning deﬁcits and anxiety, which
exacerbate each other, as opposed to one causing the other (Testimony of Dr. Heitzman, p. 116,
Testimony of Language Arts Specialist; B—88)

14. Dr. Heitzman’s evaluation contained a list of recommendations, of which some but not all were
implemented by the District. (B—88)

15. Student while not oppositional as that is clinically deﬁned, is challenging when you are trying to
really push her to test limits and push her to try new things. (Testimony of Dr. Heitzman, p. 21)
Student does not perceive herself as having a disability, is very resistant to recognizing her special
needs and struggles with identifying herself as a student with special needs. (Testimony of Dr.
Heitzman p. 165; B—l31, p2.) Student and Dr. Heitzman worked on analyzing situations and other
possible perceptions of events that troubled Student, but this was challenging for Student.
(Testimony of Dr. Heitzman, pp. 188—189) Student has a hard time perceiving the Views of things
that were different from her own. (Testimony of Dr. Heitzmanp. 188)

16. Student also has difﬁculty dealing with the thoughts and perspectives of other students in small
group discussions and activities. (P—8, p2) When other students are not in line with what she wants
to do or how to handle the task she gets distressed. (Id)

17. On February 21, 2014, an ecological assessment was conducted by the BCBA, which conﬁrmed
that Student’s learning environment impacts her on—task environment and as such, highly structured
predictable and quiet settings are recommended. (B-124, p.12) Recommendations in the assessment
included placement in structured settings, preferential seating, use of assistive technology, an
additional set of textbooks in the classroom, setting speciﬁc routines around organization of material
at the beginning of class, a self—monitoring system to teach Student to discriminate between her on—
task and off—task behavior in order to increase on task time, and functional communication training,
which was to be reinforced with a differential reinforcement system.

18. Student’s Educationally Based Occupational Therapy triennial evaluation was completed in May
28, 2014 and contained the results of the Test of Visual-Perceptual Skills 3rd edition (TVPS-3) on
which Student had an overall score in the 87th percentile. (B-l32, p.5) Student scored in the 77th

5

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0165

percentile in the Beery Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration (VMI). (B-132 p.
6) Student’s performance in the area of ﬁne manual control on the Bmininks—Oseretsky Test of
Motor Proﬁciency 2 was in the 73rd percentile. (B-l32, p. 7) Student’s perfonnanee on the Test of
Handwriting Skills —Revised (THS) was in the 99th percentile for accuracy, however the speed at
which Student writes letters varied between the 16th and the 50th percentile. (B—l 32, p. 6)

19. A Language Aits evaluation was conducted as pan of Student’s 2014 triennial evaluation. (B—
128) Student scored in the average to well above average in the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test—lll
and in the average to above average in in all areas of the Test of Written Language with the
exception of the vocabulary subtest of the contrived writing section on which she scored below
average. Student’s spontaneous writing score was in the 39th percentile, Which when combined with
the contrived writing score in the 68th percentile contributed to the overall writing score falling in
the 6lstpe1'eentile. (B-128, p.6)

20. Student Was evaluated in math as part of her triennial evaluation by the substitute case manager
for seventh grade. (B-177) Student placed in the above average range overall. (1d)

21. An Assistive Technology Consultation Report was issued by a member of the Assistive
Technology Team on April 24, 2014. The AT team member recommended a speciﬁc application that
would suppoit Student’s lEP goals. (Id) The application recommended was available on all school
computers. (B—188, pp. 409—410).) Beginning slowly with only one or two functions of the
application at ﬁrst was recommended, as was the issuing of an iPad to Student for the 2014—201 5
school year. (1d.)

22. The Diagnostic Study completed in May of 2014 by the school psychologist, who did not testify
at the hearing, indicated that Student has a low processing speed and although her academic ﬂuency
is in the average range her ﬂuency with simple math problems was within the low average range. (B—
l3l, p. 5.) Student’s reading and writing ﬂuencies are within the average range. (ld.) Student’s
ability to sustain efﬁciency in tasks of little interest is negatively affected. (1d,) Diagnosis of ADHD
was conﬁnned through administration of the Connors 3 test. (ld.) Results on the BRIEF conﬁrmed
Dr. Heitzman’s analysis that shifting tasks is a challenge, (B—l3l, p 6) The school psychologist
recommended clear instructions broken down into steps, access to checklists for multistep tasks,
verbal cuing, estimating time needed to complete a task and assessment of accuracy of estimate
afteiwards, models for self—monitoring, allowing self—direction in choosing areas of academic
interest, use of graphic organizers when writing, modiﬁcation of homework and additional time on
tests and written assignments, clear organized presentation of information. (B—l3l, p. 6)

Student’s Academic Achievement during Middle School and Standardized Testing

23. During Student’s sixth grade year, Student received grades ranging from a B to an A— in
Student’s core academic classes, with the exception of Spanish, in which she received a P for
Pass/Fail. (B—l72) Student received grades of A— to A+ in her six Uniﬁed Arts/Elective courses. (B—
172) Student took the Connecticut Mastery Test in 6th grade and placed at the advanced level for
mathematics and reading and at the goal level for writing. (B-99)

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0165

24. During Student’s 7th grade year, Student received grades ranging from B to A- in her core
academic classes, with the exception of Spanish, in which Student received a letter grade of C. (B—
172) Student received grades ranging from a B to A+ in her Uniﬁed Arts/Elective courses. ad.)

25. In eighth grade, with the exception of Spanish in which Student received a letter grade of C,
Student received grades ranging from B to A- in her core academic classes. Student received grades
ranging from a B+ to A in her Uniﬁed Arts/Elective courses. (B-172)

26. Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment (“SBAC”) results from testing administered in the
spring of 2015 placed Student at a Level 4 out of 4 Levels in the subject area of English, Language
Arts and Literacy, demonstrating that Student had exceeded the achievement level expected for
eighth grade students. (B-173) Student’s SBAC Math results placed her at a Level 3, which
indicated Student has met the achievement level for Mathematics expected for this grade. (Id.)

27. Student’s ability to achieve grades reﬂective of her academic ability was not a concern expressed
by teachers. (P—8, p.1)

Seventh and Eighth Grade IEPs and Implementation

28. From 2008, through the date of the ﬁling of the hearing request, Parents have responded quickly
to what they believed were inaccuracies and omissions in documents produced as a result of PPT
meetings with comments and requests for correction. (B—13, B-23, B—28)

29. During Student’s seventh and eighth grade years, PPT meetings were held on September 11,
2013, October 23, 2013, March 12, 2014, May 29, 2014, October 27, 2014, September 10, 2014,
December 23, 2014, Apri121, 2015 and September 11, 2015. (B-116, B—121, B-127, B-133, B-138B,
B—140, B-136, B-145, B-151.)

30. Student’s Present Levels of Academic Achievement and F unetional Performance (“PLAAFP”) in
June of 2013 and for successive IEPs were noted to be age appropriate in all areas except the
academic/cognitive area of language arts, ﬁne and gross motor skills, and
other/acadernic/nonacademic areas, where Student’s executive functioning deﬁcits were noted. (B—
197, p. 5) (B-l26, B—126A, B—133) Student’s PLAAFP were modiﬁed in the October 27, 2014 IEP
to include concerns about behavioral and social and emotional concerns being age inappropriate. (B—
138, p.5) These concerns are duplicative of those previously listed under
other/academic/nonacademic areas.

31. Student’s IEP for the 2013-2014 school year, Student’s seventh grade year, contained the
following special education services: 2.10 hours of writing instruction weekly in the general
education setting, 1.67 hours of weekly small group/individual leaming strategies instruction, and .7
hours a week of small group/individual academic support (B-108, p. 19) Occupational therapy
occurring .7 hours a week was ine1uded as a related service. (1d.)

32. N0 disagreements with the goals and objectives that were developed at the June 2013 PPT to
address the areas of writing, executive functioning, and ﬁne motor skills were noted in the IEP
summary. (B—107, p. 2 and pp. 8-14)

33. Dr. Heitzman was impressed by the amount of data collection done by the school staff when he
met with them in November of 2013. (P-8, pp. 1-2)

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0165

34. Classroom teachers completed checklists of Student’s performance on a weekly basis and these
were sent to parents every two to three weeks. (B—177, p. 146)

35. A PPT meeting was held on September 11, 2013, during which Parents, through the Parent
Advocate, requested clariﬁcation of how the data and progress monitoring would align with the
goals of the IEP. (B—116, p. 2) As a result of this discussion Goal 1 was modiﬁed so that objective
one set forth a system in which writing prompts were to be scored three times, ﬁrst draft, second
draft and then completed with technology. (B—116, p. 7). Although the summary indicated that the
three step scoring process would be speciﬁed in Goal 2 and would involve a social studies focus, the
changes were applied to objective 2 under goal 1. (B—116)

36. Around Thanksgiving 2013, Dr. Heitzrnan met with members of Student’s school team and
reported his impressions to Parents in an email on December 3, 2014. (P—8, p. 1) Dr. Heitzman
acknowledged in this email that the team seemed to have done a LOT of work behind the scenes to
identify target issues. (1d,) Dr. Heitzman identiﬁed two general themes based on data and teacher
reports: transitions and ﬂexibility of Student’s perspective in class. (Testimony of Dr. Heitzman p.
33; P-8, p.1.)

37. Although Student did not master her IEP goals and objectives, she made satisfactory progress on
them and, as evidenced by her grades, was able to make progress in the general educational
curriculum. Student’s progress on her 2013-2014 occupational therapy goal and objectives was
included at the end of Student’s triennial evaluation. (B-132, pp. 7-9) The occupational therapist
reported that Student demonstrated partial mastery of Objective 1, mastery of Objective 2, partial
mastery of Objective 3 and satisfactory in Objective 4. (Id)

38. Progress reports on Student’s goals and objectives for the 2013-2014 school year were produced
on November 2013 and February, April and May 28, 2014. (B—121, B-122C, B—129A, 132A)

39. Progress reports on Student’s goals and objectives for the 2014-2015 school year were produced
on November 2014 and February, April and June 2015. (B—139, B—143, B-l47)

40. Whether or not all of the Progress reports were sent home is disputed by Parents and the District.
(Testimony of Mother and Substitute Case Manager) It was not until Parent assembled her records
to give to the educational consultant, that she found she was missing the April 2014 and June 2014
summaries. (Testimony of Mother)

41. Writing objectives that were present in Student’s IEP in March of 2014 were not present on
Student’s IEP on May 29, 2014. (B-126, B-l33) Parents were emailed a draft of the IEP with the
discrete writing goal removed on May 28, 2014 by the seventh grade Substitute case manager. (B-
177, p.440—445) At Mother’s request, a PPT meeting was held in October 2014 and writing goals
and objectives were added to the IEP. (Testimony of Mother; B—138B) The PPT summary states that
the PPT had decided to add a writing goal that was inadvertently omitted. (B—138, p. 2)

42. Student had four case managers over the space of two years due to maternity leaves. B-l79, p.
12) This was due to two maternity leaves. Transitions between providers were planned and involved
providers overlapping and working together before the actual transition to the substitute. (Testimony
of Eighth Grade Case Manager)

43. The BCBA consulted with District Staff during the 2014—201 5 school year on data collection and
data analysis. (B-lSS)

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0165

44. Weekly summaries of Student’s performance in her classes were sent by email to the Parents by
her case managers. (B-177, p. 27 and p. 293) A chant of baseline data on writing focus areas per the
request of the Parent Advocate was generated on June 24, 2013. (B-111) There were regular team
meetings with staff and Parents outside of the PPT meetings that were held.

45. In keeping with the recommendations of the school psychologist in his triennial evaluation,
several checklists were utilized with Student. (Testimony of Seventh Grade Case Manager, p.34 and
p. 56) Data was collected and analyzed under the supervision of the District BCBA. (Testimony of
BCBA, p. 27, Testimony of Seventh Grade Case Manager; P—5 3) Although Student felt the simple
nature of the checklists made them babyish and that she didn’t need behavior plans, Dr. Heitzman
saw value in Student starting small. (Testimony of Dr. Heitzman, pr 63) Student has a hard time
starting off with small steps. (1d.)

46. Requests for the data on which progress was being measured were not met in some instances or
there was a signiﬁcant delay in receipt of the documentation. Writing samples were not provided
until the return of the eighth grade case manager from maternity leave. (Testimony of Eighth Grade
Case Manager, p. 176) Data was produced at the hearing by the eighth grade case manager, which
had not been provided previously to Parents. (Testimony of Eighth Grade Case Manager, p. 204)
47. Dr. Heitzman participated in the PPT in which counseling services were identiﬁed for the
upcoming 2013-2014 school year. (Testimony of Dr. Heitzman, p. 30)

School Response to Parent Requests about Other Students

48. On June 9, 2014, Mother sent an email to Student’s guidance counselor, requesting that Student
not be in certain classes with a speciﬁc student during the 14—15 school year, to which the guidance
counselor responded that her request was noted in the Student’s records, but that it might not be
possible to separate the children in Music and/or PE classes, but that if both students had PE at the
same time, the children could be separated. (P-79)

49. On November 4, 2014, Mother met with the principal to discuss her concerns about Student
being upset at having been enrolled in a health class section, which according to Student had 5
paraprofessionals and the most atypical kids in her grade. (P-82) As a result of this conversation,
Student was moved to a different health section. (P-82)

Tutoring

50. In 2014, Parents hired a tutor from a company called A Way to Learn. (Testimony of Mother)
This tutor assisted Student in homework completion and sent reports of her work with Student to
Mother regularly. (Testimony of Mother, P-103 p.1—90) Student was tutored through Student’s
enrollment in the Spire School. (Testimony of Mother) Some of the tutoring session were dedicated
to SSAT test preparation for Student’s application to private schools. (105 pp.82—83) Tutor’s
intervention with Student on writing prompts compromised them as assessments for the purposes of
this hearing.

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0165

51. In the summer between Student’s seventh and eighth grade school years, Parents sent Student to
the Explo Program, a private residential program held on the campus of Wellesley College in
Massachusetts, Which provides enrichment opportunities through coursework in a wide variety of
disciplines. (Testimony of Mother) Student’s experience was not a good one, due to the
incompatibility of the independent nature of the program and Student’s executive functioning
deﬁcits. Student had conﬂicts with an international roommate from Asia and didn’t feel she
advocated for herself in those conﬂicts. (Testimony of Mother) The program director informed
Mother at the end of the program that changes would have to be made before Student would be
allowed to attend in the following year. (Id.)

52. Concerned after the camp experience, Mother then contacted Dr. Heitzman and hired him to
provide counseling to Student. (Testimony of Mother) Dr. Heitzman began counseling with Student
and would alternate the focus in sessions between social and emotional areas and executive
functioning. (Testimony of Dr. Heitzman) Dr. Heitzman’s role at this time shifts to that of clinician
and thus is no longer able to conduct evaluations of the Student. (Testimony of Dr. Heitzrnan p. 156)
53. Dr, Heitzman’s sessions were twice a week but moved to once a week over time. (Testimony of
Dr. Heitzman)

54. With regards to Student’s perceptions of bullying, Dr. Heitzman did not hear anything during
his sessions with Student that was putting Student in any kind of risk or harm or anything else that
would require him to step in with the schools and teachers. (Testimony of Dr. Heitzrnan, p. 77)

Bullying

55. On September 30, 2013, Mother contacted the Spanish teacher after Student reported that
Student had forgotten to bring a pen or pencil and told the entire class that one of them should lend
her a pen because Student chews on pencils, at which point the class laughed at Student and then
later the Student who lent her a pencil threw the pen in the garbage to get another laugh from the
other Students. (P—6)

56. In May 2014, an allegation of another student bullying Student in Spanish class was brought to
the attention of the Dean. (Testimony of Dean of Students. pp. 115—116) The speciﬁc allegation was
that the other student told Student she needed to get, or use a tissue. (Id.) The Dean investigated the
incident by calling the other student down to his ofﬁce, where the student admitted that he had made
the statement. (1d) The Dean determined it was a mean-spirited comment, not bullying, and gave the
other student a consequence. (1d)

57. Dean was not aware of the prior incident in 2013 with the Spanish teacher, when the May 2014
incident occurred. That incident had been handled by assistant principal, Mr. Banner, because it
involved a teacher. (Testimony of Dean of Students, p.117) The peer who made the comment about
Student needing a tissue was one of the students who laughed when the Spanish teacher made the
comment about the pencils. (1d,) The District took steps to ensure that this peer and Student were not
in the same crew (core) classes going forward. (Testimony of Dean of Students, p.17) While not
always possible to separate children who have had negative interactions in the Uniﬁed Arts classes,

10

 

July 21 , 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0165

the District works to separate children in their core crew classes.(Testimony of Dean of Students,
p.118) Kelly Cummings, the guidance counselor, assisted in this process.

58. Student had a difﬁcult time with the Spanish teacher due to personality differences. (Testimony
of Seventh Grade Substitute Case Manager). Despite these differences, Student was able to make
educational progress in Spanish. (Testimony of Seventh Grade Substitute Case Manager; B-177,
page 137)

59. Mother sent an email in F ebruary 7, 2014 informing the substitute case manager that Student is
getting increasingly upset about what was occurring in Spanish class. (B—177, p. 211) The
substitute case manager worked with Spanish teacher on strategies to use with Student and spoke
with Spanish teacher because she felt that it was a good idea for Spanish teacher and mother to speak
directly about issues pertaining to Student, rather than having the substitute case manager act as the
middleman. (Testimony of Seventh Grade Substitute Case Manager May 9, 2016, p. 69; B-177, p.
208) The case manager reported that towards the end of the school year Student’s relationship with
the Spanish teacher and Student’s enthusiasm towards Spanish increased. (Testimony of Seventh
Grade Substitute Case Manager May 9, 2016, p. 70—71; B-177, p. 229)

60. In June of 2014, a staff member brought an incident to the Dean’s attention in which a peer had
made a comment to Student in Art class regarding Student arriving late to class and said good bye to
Student at the end of class, and Student was upset by these comments, (Testimony of Dean of
Students) The Dean investigated the incident by interviewing 12—13 students. (1d,) The peer admitted
to having these interactions with Student and was disciplined. (1d,) As a proactive measure, the
peer’s locker was changed to a different location, since it was located near Student’s (1d,)

61. In October 2014, a concern was brought to Dean’s attention that Student had expressed that she
felt peer was making fun of her in art class and was taking the clay coils she had made and glaring at
her. (Testimony of the Dean of Students) The Dean investigated this by speaking to the teacher and
the peer. (1d.) The Peer denied interactions reported by Student and the art teacher did not conﬁrm
Student’s perceptions of these interactions. (1d,) N0 disciplinary action was taken in response to
Student’s allegations. (1d,) During a conversation with Student about the peer from alt class, Student
informed Dean about an incident involving that same peer in which she thought that the peer was
taking pictures of her wearing a costume while volunteering at an off—campus event called the
Enchanted Castle. (Testimony of the Dean of Students) The Dean interviewed the peer, who reported
that he had asked Student if he could take her picture and she had declined. (Testimony of the Dean
of Students) The Dean then went through peer’s phone and did not see any pictures of Student. (Id)
Dean warned the peer that there would be negative consequences if pictures of peer at this event
were surfaced and disseminated. (1d,). No evidence was presented at the hearing that photographs
were taken of Student 01' that photographs of Student were posted or distributed physically or
electronically. (Id.)

62. On May 6, 2015, Mother sent an emai1 to the principal, on which the Dean of Students and
several other staff members were copied, in which she stated Student was reporting multiple students
kicking her rolling backpack after she passes by, that this had been happening every morning since
before Christmas, and asking to speak with the Dean of Students; arrangements were made for a
phone conference that day. (P-85, p 2; B-179, p. 753)

11

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0165

63. In response to Mother’s concerns, the Dean of Students interviewed Student in the presence of
other staff members (Testimony of the Dean of Students) During the intewiew, Student stated the
kicking occurred in the mornings and that she was unsure who was doing the kicking and declined
the Dean’s offer to go through the yearbook to try to identify Students. (P-133)

64. The day after the Dean met with Student, Mother sent an email expressing concern that Student
was intimidated by the number of adults in the room and that Mother was unclear as to whether
Student had told the Dean everything that was bothering her. (P-85) In response to Mother’s
concern, the Dean had a follow-up conference with Student. (Testimony of Dean of Students) The
Student was unable to given any more information about who she thought might be kicking her
backpack. (P. 134) The Dean spoke with Student and suggested that the next time Student felt
someone was kicking her backpack she should stop and see who it might have been. (Testimony of
Dean of Students)

65. The Dean then reviewed Video recordings of the eighth grade hallway during arrival time on
seven to eight days and did not observe any time in which Student’s backpack was kicked. (P-133)
Access to Video was limited by the fact the school only maintains 30 days of Video. (1d,) The Dean
spoke with classmates whose lockers were near Student’s locker and these classmates did report that
other students were deliberately kicking Student’s backpack. (P. 136)

66. Mother stated that Student continued to report that kicking of Student’s backpack continued after
Dean reviewed the videotapes. (Testimony of Mother) No evidence was offered at the hearing to
show that Mother or Student repotted that the kicking continued to occur.

67. Mother and the Dean also spoke on the phone regarding concerns Mother had about an
overnight ﬁeld trip to Philadelphia that Student had taken with her classmates and on which Mother
served as a chaperone. (Testimony of Dean of Students) During this trip, Mother expressed that a
group of students pushed past Student and her friends in a msh to get to the buffet. (Id.) The Dean,
who was on the trip and ate last, did not witness the incident that Mother described. (Id.) Neither
Student nor Mother reported this incident to the Dean or raised any other concems during the ﬁeld
trip. (Id.)

2015-2016 IEP and Unilateral Placement

68. On April 2, 2015, Dr. Heitzman sent an email to Student’s guidance counselor and the school
psychologist, in an effort to get out in front of anticipated disputes at the upcoming April 21, 2015
PPT meeting. (P—90) In this email, he included questions about Student’s proposed program for the
upcoming year and shared inputs about the Student’s needs. (Id.)

69. Dr. Heitzman indicated in his email his “...belief that placement with an equivalent social peer—
group needs to take priority over learning—needs peer group.” (P-90) Dr. Heitzman’s position was
based on his belief that if Student’s social needs were met by not placing her in environments with
students with observable disabilities, then more of her attentional resources would shift to her
education. (Id.)

70. In the same email in which Dr. Heitzman stated that Student should not be grouped according to
her academic needs, he requested a description of the collaborative classroom setting, because the
Parents were “...imagining a larger classroom with the same proportion of children with signiﬁcant

12

 

J uly 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0165

developmental needs i.e. Autism and Down Syndrome, etc. rather than “garden variety” LD 0r
ADHD and more typical peers.” (P—90) Dr. Heitzman also passed along the concerns that Parents
had about academic rigor based on rumors they had heard about collaborative classes. (1d,)

71. Mother had previously expressed to Student’s tutor that Student had been grouped with a student
with Down syndrome and a severely autistic student at school which in Student’s mind contributes
to classmates thinking that she is “stupid”. (P—82)

72. On April 24, 2015, Mother requested that Dr. Heitzman have the opportunity to obsewe multiple
freshman collaborative classes. (Testimony of Mother; P—9l, p.2) In response, the high school
housemaster indicated that collaborative team members would be made available for a meeting with
Dr. Heitzman, but that he would not be able to observe current classes. (P-91, p. 1.) When Mother
asked why that was, the Director of Special Education responded that it would be disruptive to the
educational process for him to observe multiple classes at the high school and again offered to make
collaborative staff available for a meeting. (Id) The District also indicated Dr. Heitzman would be
allowed to observe Student in her placement. (1d,)

73. The main purpose of Dr. Heitzman’s observation of collaborative classrooms was not to vet the
academic level of the curriculum, but to see whether there were students whose disabilities were
readily apparent and obvious, either because of facial characteristics or behavior. (Testimony of Dr.
Heitzman, p. 197) Dr. Heitzman believed this was important due to his theory that Student was too
distracted by her academic placement and being with children with more obvious disabilities to have
the ability to succeed as a Student. (Testimony of Dr. Heitzman, p. 83)

74. At the hearing Mother testiﬁed that she believed that in addition to observing the kinds of
disabilities other students had, Dr. Heitzman would be able to judge the “speed” of the class and
notice if there were interruptions due to noise. (Testimony of Mother, March 21, 2016, p. 61)

75. In addition to the opportunity given to Dr. Heitzman to speak with teachers in the high school, a
member of the high school staff was present at the PPT meeting for ninth grade, who described the
collaborative classes. (Testimony of Mother, March 21, 2016)

76. In the months leading up to the PPT meeting which would address Student’s lEP for the ninth
grade year, Parents and Student explored the option of attending the Bridgepmt Regional
Aquaculture Science & Technology Education Center (“Aquaculture program”), an off-site program
in which Student would spend the morning and then transition to F airﬁeld Warde High School for
the second half of the school day. (Testimony of Mother) In the winter of 2015, Student applied for
and was accepted into the Aquaculture Program and Mother signed a form conﬁrming Student
would be attending this program on February 4, 2015. (B—14OA)

77. At Student’s annual review PPT meeting held on April 21, 2015, Student’s Individualized
Education Program for the 2015—2016 school year was discussed by the PPT, which included a
representative from the Aquaculture program, and the IEP developed was based on the belief that
Student would be attending Aquaculture program. (B—145, p. l)

78. The April 2015 lEP for the 2015—2016 school year included placement in collaborative classes
for English, Global Studies and Math and Learning Center Support of 2 hours and 45 minutes every
4 day cycle. (B—l45, p. 2) Related services recommended included occupational therapy of 30
minutes per week, an occupational therapy consultation once per month and counseling at a
frequency of 30 minutes every 2 weeks. (B—145, p. 25) The proposed IEP indicates that due to

13

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0165

increased Learning Center time from once to twice a week, Student would miss gym once a week
and would also miss classroom instruction when participating in occupational therapy. (B—145, p.
26)

79. There was an open house at the Aquaculture program at which Student saw children whom she
believed had bullied her in the middle school and Student subsequently lost interest in attending the
program in June. (Testimony of Mother) Parents did not notify the District that Student was no
longer interested in attending the Aquaculture program. (Testimony of Mother)

80. After the April 2015 PPT meeting, Parents decided Student’s p1acement in collaborative classes
was unacceptable and began to look into alternative programs. (Testimony of Mother) Parents hired
Dr. Laura Seese, psychologist, as an educational consultant in June of 2015. (Testimony of
Educational Consultant; B-149) Dr. Seese reviewed the educational records provided to her by
Mother, spoke with Mother and the Parent Advocate and interviewed Student in the second week of
June. (1d,) Despite being retained prior to the end of the school year, the educational consultant did
not speak to anyone from the Fairﬁeld Public Schools, at either the middle school or high school
level. (Testimony of Educational Consultant; B—149)

81. On August 22, 2015, the educational consultant drafted a letter to Parents which contained a
review of the records provided to her and a recommendation that Student be placed at the Spire
School. (B-149) No other placement was recommended by the educational consultant, and the other
placements that were reviewed and rejected by the educational consultant as not qualifying as an
appropriate placement in the least restrictive environment were not identiﬁed in the letter (1d.) On
August 23, 2015 or August 25, 2015 (it is difﬁcult to tell from the handwriting whether it is a 3 or a
5, Father executed the contract for the Spire School. (P—42) Mother executed it on August 25, 2015.
(P—42)

82. On September 11, 2015, a PPT meeting was held to review the letter written by the educational
consultant and to address the issue of Parent’s notice of unilateral placement. (Testimony of High
School Special Education Coordinator) The school based PPT members were teachers and other
staff members from the high school. (Testimony of High School Special Education Coordinator)
83. The PPT made changes to the April 2015 IEP by condensing Goal One Objectives 3, 4 and 5 into
Objective 3, in order to address the inability to collect baseline data as set forth in the previous IEP
objectives, since the Student had already been outplaced and started the year somewhere else.
(Testimony of High School Special Education Coordinator; B—151) Changes were also made to
address a concern about referencing a middle school rubric in an IEP for a rising ninth grader.
(Testimony of High School Special Education Coordinator; B—151)

84. The PPT, as a result of learning that Student would not be attending the Aquaculture Program,
added a collaboratively taught Science program to the September 11, 2015 IEP. (Testimony of High
School Special Education Coordinator; B—151)

85. After considering the letter from the educational consultant regarding concerns that Student
needed clinical therapeutic support, the PPT proposed that Student be evaluated for Effective School
Solutions “1388”. (Testimony of High School Special Education Coordinator; B-151) ESS entered
into a contract with the Fairﬁeld Public Schools in .1 une of 201 5. (P-97)

86. Effective School Solutions offers group and individual therapy and psychoeducation in the form
of a learning strategies class taught by a clinician and a special education teacher. (Testimony of

14

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0165

ESS Representative, p. 19, Testimony of High School Special Education Coordinator) The learning
strategies class would take the place of two of the three electives Student would be able to take if she
were not participating in ESS. (Testimony of High School Special Education Coordinator) ESS also
offers family therapy and parent suppmt groups (Testimony of ESS representative, p. 19)
87. After the PPT recommended Student be evaluated by ESS on September 11, 2015, Parents did
not sign consent for Effective School Solutions to do so. (Testimony of High School Special
Education Coordinator, p.47) During the intake evaluation, a diagnosis is developed and a treatment
. plan for that diagnosis is created with objectives for treatment. (Testimony of EES Representative, p.
21) The evaluation process includes completion of a 20 page evaluation form and a meeting with
Parents and Student which lasts from one and a half to two hours. (Testimony of EES
Representative, p. 25.)
88. Students in ESS currently have mental health issues such as major depressive disorder, anxiety
disorder, bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. (Testimony of ESS Representative)
Students in ESS would normally have ADHD and/or executive functioning disorders as secondary,
rather than primary diagnoses. (Testimony of ESS representative) ESS provides a higher level of
inteivention to be accessed when lesser interventions have failed. (Testimony of ESS representative)
89. 1f Student was not accepted into ESS, then Student would receive 30 minutes of counseling
every two weeks set forth under the existing IEP, however EES would refer them to the level of care
their evaluation indicated Student needed. (Testimony of High School Special Education
Coordinator, Testimony of EES Representative, p. 28; B-15 1) Paiticipation in ESS would have
precluded Student from paiticipating in the Aquaculture program, but the educational consultant had
already determined participation in aquaculture (Testimony of Educational Consulatant p. 125)
90. The District’s high school organizes groups of students into houses. (Testimony of High School
Special Education Coordinator) In response to concern about Student’s physical limitations, Student
was moved from her original placement in a house in the high school which had an ofﬁce on the
second ﬂoor to a house with an ofﬁce on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. (Testimony of High School Special
Education Coordinator)
91. The curriculum taught in the collaborative classrooms is the standard ninth grade curriculum, and
which is tested through common grade—wide assessments. (Testimony of High School Special
Education Coordinator)
92. Parents requested placement at The Spire School at the September 11, 2015 PPT meeting, citing
concern about Student sticking out as a special education student under the IEP proposed by the
District; the District refused this request. (Testimony of High School Special Education
Coordinator)
93. The Spire School has been approved as a state approved private special education school.
(Testimony of Spire Life Coach, 1). 97)
94. Students at Spire have mild to moderate learning disabilities and some sort of social or emotional
needs such as anxiety, depression or a mood disorder and are on or at grade level. (Testimony of
Spire Life Coach, March 21, 2016, p. 100) Spire’s staff includes a clinical psychologist, a licensed
professional counselor, a social worker and two school counselors, any of whom Student can access.
(Testimony of Spire Life Coach, March 21, 2016, p. 97 and p.100) There are 15 ceitiﬁed teachers
and 4 special education teachers. (Testimony of Spire Life Coach, March 21, 2016, p.101)

15

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0165

Occupational therapy is provided at the school. (Testimony of Spire Life Coach, March 21, 2016, p.
101. P—41)

95. Since the beginning of the 2015-2016, Student’s schedule at Spire has been modiﬁed. Music has
been replaced by a learning lab (study ha11) and an additional executive functioning class was added.
(Testimony of Spire Life Coach, March 21, 2016, p. 104)

96. Student’s schedule includes an Executive Function Group of 4 students and two executive
function coaching sessions in a one to one setting. (Testimony of Spire Life Coach, March 21, 2016,
p. 105) Student also has access to therapeutic staff throughout the day, in addition to scheduled
therapy sessions. (Testimony of Spire Life Coach)

97. Student’s anxiety has subsided since her arrival at Spire. Her anxiety had manifested itself in
Student eating tissues. (Testimony of Spire Life Coach, March 21, 2016, p. 116)

98. At the time of initial enrollment at Spire at the beginning of Student’s ninth grade year, teachers
were completing Student’s homework and scribing it for her. (Testimony of Spire Life Coach,
March 21, 2016, p. 118) Student has since been transitioned to doing it herself which staff
understands would result in missing assignments. (Testimony of Spire Life Coach, March 21, 2016,
p.119) Student has friends at Spire. (Testimony of Spire Life Coach, March 21, 2016, p. 123)

100. Student is permitted a three minute buffer between classes ((Testimony of Spire Life Coach,
March 21 , 2016, p. 131) Student continues to require prompting and a lot of redirection. (Testimony
of Spire Life Coach, March 21, 2016, 13.138

101, Student’s grades for the ﬁrst quarter of Spire in 2015—2016 ranged from B— to A. (P—53)

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DISCUSSION:

1.

The standard for review of special education programs for individual students with disabilities was
established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Board of Education offhe Hendrick Hudson
Central School District v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982). Rowley established two tests: 1) were the
procedural requirements of the Act complied with; and 2) was the educational program developed
for the child reasonably expected to provide educational beneﬁt.

The design of the IEP for Student’s 2013—2014 was appropriate under the second prong of Rowley.
The goals and objectives were reasonably calculated for Student to make progress in the areas of
concern noted on Student’s PLAAFP. (Findings of Fact No. 23—25) Parents, with assistance from
Parent Advocate, advocated for and obtained changes to the IEP and these were implemented,
demonstrating they had a meaningful opportunity to participate in the process. (F inding of Fact No.
28) With consultation from Dr. Heitzman, staff were assisted in better understanding Student.
(Finding of Fact N0. 36) Although Student did not master her goals and objectives, she made
satisfactory progress on them and, as evidenced by her grades and test scores, was able to make
progress in general educational curriculum. (Findings of Fact No., 24, 25, 26, 37) To the extent
there were claims of inconsistency of staff, these claims were found to be without merit as the
District was aware of the transitions in advance and planned appropriately for them. (Finding of F act
N0. 42)

16

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0165

3. The proposed IEP for the 2015-2016 school year was not appropriate under the second prong of
Rowley because the therapeutic services offered were not sufﬁcient for Student who was
transitioning to high school and who suffers from signiﬁcant anxiety which exacerbates her
executive functioning issues. While the goals and objectives were reasonably calculated for Student
to make progress in the areas of concern noted on Student’s PLAAFP, and Student’s grades indicate
that she was able to make progress in the general education curriculum during the year, the inclusion
of 30 minutes of counseling every two week was not sufﬁcient, even if Student was not going to
attend the Aquaculture Program, with its multiple daily transitions which were inappropriate for the
Student.

4. The District did not deny Student at FAPE in the 2013—2014 and 2014-2015 school year when writing
goals were removed from Student’s IEP on May 29, 2014 and writing goals were not added until
October 27, 2014. (F inding of Fact N0. 41) Parents had a copy of the draft IEP without the writing
goal before the PPT meeting. (Finding of Fact N0. 41) Being in possession of this draft invalidates
claims that the writing goals were unilaterally removed without notice to the parents. The record
supports a ﬁnding that the District statement that the goals were inadvertently dropped in the
October 2014 IEP was inaccurate, The District, at the time the IEP was drafted, had a Language
Arts evaluation which indicated Student was performing at an average level. (Finding of F act No.
19) Changes to the goals and objectives were noted in the IEP summary. While Parents did not have
access to all of the data underlying the progress reports generated by staff that they requested,
enormous amounts of information was provided to them over Student’s seventh grade years in the
form of weekly emails from case managers, weekly checklists completed by classroom teachers, and
progress reports. (F indings of F act, N0. 34, 42, and 44) There was insufﬁcient evidence to support
Mother’s allegation that the progress reports were not generated and sent.

5. Student was not denied a FAPE as a result of bullying during her seventh and eighth grade years. A
District’s failure to address bullying can result in a ﬁnding of a substantive Violation of the Student’s
right to a FAPE. T.K v. New York Cily Dep ’2‘ ofEduc., 779 F.Supp. 2d 289 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 28,
2011) The District Court in this case set forth a four-part test to determine whether signiﬁcant,
unremedied bullying could constitute a denial of FAPE. (ld.) To determine whether a substantive
denial of a FAPE has occurred, the fact—ﬁnder must apply the following analysis: (1) Was Student a
victim of bullying; (2) Did the school have notice of the substantial bullying of the student; (3) Was
the school “deliberately indifferent” to the bullying, or did it fail to take reasonable steps to prevent
the bullying; and (4) Did the bullying “substantially restrict” the student’s educational opportunities?
(Id.)] A failure to address bullying can also result in a ﬁnding of a procedural violation of Student’s
right to a FAPE. TK. v. New York City 810 F.3d. 869, 67 IDELR 1 (United States Court of Appeals,
2nd Circuit (2016)) Before any analysis of a denial of FAPE as a result of bullying can be
undertaken, bullying must be deﬁned. Although bullying is not deﬁned under the IDEA, or

I The second circuit declined to put its imprimatur on the four-pait test promulgated in the District Court’s ruling, T,K. v.
New York City 810 F.3d. 869> 67 IDELR 1 (United States Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit (2016))

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16~0165

elsewhere in federa1 law, the HS Depaitment of Education and the Ofﬁce of Special Education
Programs (“OSEP”) and the Connecticut legislature have provided deﬁnitions. OSEP has deﬁned
bullying as follows: Bullying is characterized by aggression used within a relationship where the
aggressor(s) has more real or perceived power than the target, and the aggression is repeated, or has
the potential to be repeated, over time. Bullying can involve oveit physical behavior or verbal,
emotional, or social behaviors (e,g., excluding someone from social activities, making threats,
withdrawing attention, destroying someone’s reputation) and can range from blatant aggression to
far more subtle and covert behaviors. Cyberbu11ying, or bullying through electronic technology (e.g.
cell phones, computers, online/social media), can include offensive text messages or e-mails, rumors
or embarrassing photos posted on social media networking sites, 01' fake online proﬁles. Q63;
Colleague Letter 61 IDELR 263 (United States Department of Education, Ofﬁce of Special
Education and Rehabilitative Services and the Ofﬁce of Special Education Programs (2013)

In Connecticut the legislature has passed an anti—bullying law in which, bullying is deﬁned as:

(A) the repeated use by one 01' more students of a written, oral or electronic communication,
such as cyberbullying, directed at or referring to another student attending school in the
same school district, 01' (B) a physical act or gesture by one or more students repeatedly
directed at another student attending school in the same school district, that: (i) causes
physical or emotional harm to such student or damage to such student's propeity, (ii) places
such student in reasonable fear of harm to himself or herself, or of damage to his or her
propeity, (iii) creates a hostile environment at school for such student, (iv) infringes on the
rights of such student at school, or (V) substantially disrupts the education process or the

electronic communication or physical act or gesture based on any actual or perceived
differentiating characteristic, such as race, c0101; religion, ancestry, national origin, gender,
sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, socioeconomic status, academic status,
physical appearance, or mental, physical, developmental or sensory disability, 01' by
association with an individual 01' group who has or is perceived to have one or more of such
characteristics. Connecticut General Statutes §10-222(d)

Parents, who are advocating the application of the District Couit’s four~part test argue in their brief
against the use of the Connecticut statutory deﬁnition of bullying, by pointing out that the District
Court in T.K. v. New York City Dep ’t 0fEdua, 779 F.Supp. 2d 289 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2011) did not
require that the harassment student experienced meet a state statutory deﬁnition of bullying as pait of
the four—pait analysis. Parents did not cite a deﬁnition of bullying in their brief and failed to note that
while a state statutory deﬁnition was not explicit1y referenced, the District Coult apparently
recognized the need to provide a deﬁnition of bu11ying before applying the four—pai't test and provided
such a deﬁnition in Section II (E)(1) of its decision.

While use of Connecticut’s statutory deﬁnition 0fbu11ying is not mandated; it is not prohibited. Using
the deﬁnition the Districts are already required to use when investigating any bullying incident,
provides consistency for school districts and parents who may need guidance on how to address and
more importantly prevent harassment of special education and general education students in schools.

Student was c1ear1y the subject of an extremely inappropriate and hurtful comment by her Spanish
teacher. (Finding of F act 55) The hurt caused by the teacher’s comment was exacerbated by the
actions of a classmate who was clearly emboldened by the Spanish teacher’s comment. (Finding of
Fact 55) There were two other incidents in which Student’s perceptions that students were being
unkind to her were veriﬁed, one in which a peer told Student to get a tissue and one in which a girl
made comments to Student about being late to class and then said goodbye to Student at the end of
class in a way that Student found upsetting. (F indings of Fact 56 and 60) To the extent the
classmates in these incidents did not repeat such behaviors, those actions do not meet the deﬁnition
that such actions be repeated under the Connecticut deﬁnition of bullying or capable of being
repeated under the OSEP deﬁnition; and if there is no bullying, the ﬁrst part of the District Court test
was not met and a substantive violation under TK. v. New York City Dep ’t of Educ, 779 F .Supp. 2d
289 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2011) cannot be found. Assuming arguendo, that the acts of bullying
reported by Mother met the deﬁnition of bullying under the statute, the District staff investigated
these acts as they were reported and took action when they deemed it necessary to do so (Findings of
F act No. 60-67) The District’s actions demonstrated that the District was not indifferent to Student’s
reports and took reasonable steps to address issues as staff was made aware of them. As such the
third prong of the District’s four part test is not met and there can be no ﬁnding of a substantive
denial of a FAPE to Student under T.K. v. New York Cily Dep ’t of Educ. , 779 F.Supp. 2d 289
(E.D,N,Y. Apr, 28, 2011)

In TK, v. New York City 810 F.3d. 869, 67 IDELR 1 (United States Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit
(2016)), the Court found that the District violated Student’s procedural safeguards by repeatedly
refusing to address Parent concerns about bullying both within PPT meetings and outside of them.
Parent concerns about bullying were responded to by District as each incident was brought to the
attention of the staff. Further, there was no credible evidence that the District refused to discuss
bullying incidents with Parents at PPT meetings. In addition, the District acted proactively in
response to Parent concerns about speciﬁc peers by changing locker locations and arranging
schedules to limit interaction between peers. As such, no procedural Violation occurred and there was
not deniai of a FAPE on these grounds.

6. The District’s refusal to have Dr. Heitzman observe the proposed placement was reasonable and did
not violate Parents’ procedural safeguards. While the Department of Education encourages parents
and districts to work together to ﬁnd ways to meet the needs of students and suggests that parent
observation is one way in which needs might be met, it has published guidance stating unequivocally
that “...neither the IDEA nor the regulations implementing the statute provide parents with a general
entitlement for parents of children with disabilities, or their professional representatives, to observe
their children in any current classroom or proposedplacement. ” Emphasis added. OSEP’s Letter to
Mamas, dated May 26 2004 (42 IDELR 10). It may be necessary for an Independent Educational
Evaluator to observe a child as part of his or her evaluation and if so, he or she is entitled to do so
pursuant to 34 CFR §300.502. OSEP has issued guidance clarifying that any Independent
Educational Evaluator must be afforded the same opportunity to observe that would be provided to
Board staff when they were initiating an evaluation. (See OSEP Letter to Savit F ebruary 10, 2014

July 21, 2016 F inal Decision and Order 16—0165

(64 IDELR 250) At the time Parents requested Dr. Heitzman observe Student’s potential placement,
Dr. Heitzman had already transitioned from the role of an evaluator and consultant to that of
Student’s therapist. (Finding of Fact No. 52) Having transitioned into a therapeutic role, Dr.
Heitzman was precluded from serving as an evaluator going forward. Testimony of Dr. Heitzman.
(Finding of Fact No. 52) Since Dr. Heitzman was not conducting an Independent Educational
Evaluation and by the changed nature of his work with Student was precluded from doing so, the
District was not required to allow him to observe the proposed placement. The District’s refusal of
the request for Dr. Heitzman to observe was not a procedural Violation of the IDEA. Further, Dr.
Heitzman’s stated purpose for observing was to deteimine whether there were too many students
with disabilities that manifested themselves in outward physical appearance and/or in atypical
behaviors, because Dr. Heitzman had generated a theory that Student being in the presence of
children with more outwardly apparent disabilities, exacerbated her anxiety which in turn negatively
impacted her learning. (Finding of F act, p. 73) Setting aside consideration of whether this theory
runs counter to the spirit of the Least Restrictive Environment underpinnings of the IDEA, the
request to obsewe ninth grade collaborative classes while Student was still in eighth grade did not
make sense. The ninth grade collaborative classes in 2015 would not have the same students as were
in the ninth grade collaborative classes in 2014. If the goal was to make sure that Student was
segregated from students with Down syndrome or who manifested autistic behaviors, then an
observation would have to take place after school had started in 2015 in order to accurately assess
the makeup of the class. Dr. Heitzman’s observation would not have been useful in addressing
Parents’ other concern, which was that the curriculum in collaborative classes was not as rigorous as
that in the non-collaborative classes. In addition, Dr. Heitzman was not certiﬁed to teach middle
school in classes in the subject areas in which he sought to obsewe. District did offer to have Dr.
Heitzman observe Student in her placement.

6. Parents are seeking reimbursement for their unilateral placement of Student at the Spire School
for Student’s ninth grade year. Under the IDEA, a hearing ofﬁcer is authorized to order retroactive
tuition reimbursement if there is a ﬁnding that the District did not make a FAPE available in a timely
manner before Student’s enrollment in the private program and if the private program is appropriate.
34 CFR §300.148(c) Parents assume the ﬁnancial risk if they place their child in a private program
without consent of the District F Zorence Cty School Dist F our v. Carter By and Through Carter,
510 US. 7, 15 (1993). If Parents are not able to prove that Student was denied a FAPE, an analysis
of the appropriateness of the private program is not required. If Parents prove that Student was
denied a FAPE, then the second prong of Caiter must be analyzed. When analyzing whether a
private placement is appropriate for purposes of determining whether tuition reimbursement is
appropriate, a lesser standard is applied. “A parental placement may be found to be appropriate by a
hearing ofﬁcer or a court even if it does not meet the State standards that apply to education
provided by the SEA and LEAs.” 34 CFR §300.148(c) 1n the present case the placement is a state
approved private special education school. (Finding of Fact No. 94) The Spire School is clearly a
restrictive environment, however it is appropriate for the purposes of a unilateral placement.
(Findings of Fact No. 95) While tuition reimbursement may be ordered upon a ﬁnding that Student
was denied a FAPE and that the private program was appropriate, reimbursement may be reduced or

20

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0165

denied if Parents failed to provide notice of their intent to reject the placement, their concerns
leading to the decision to unilaterally place the Student and their intent to enroll student in private
school at public expense, parents do not consent to evaluation after notice of intent from the board,
01' upon a judicial ﬁnding of unreasonableness with respect to actions taken by the parents. 34 CFR
§300.148(b) No claims of defective notice has been made. An analysis of the failure to consent to an
evaluation and of the reasonableness of Parent’s actions is required in order to determine whether
there may be a reduction or denial of reimbursement. The District has the obligation to ensure t0 the
maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private
institutions or other care facilities are educated with children who are nondisabled and that special
classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular
educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education
in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.
34 CFR §300.114 (a)(2) In keeping with this obligation, at the September 2015 PPT meeting,
Parents were offered the opportunity to have Student be evaluated for the EES program, which had
become available during the summer following Student’s eighth grade year. (Finding of Fact No. 87)
The intake evaluation identiﬁes a diagnosis for a student and develops a treatment plan with
objectives to address needs ﬂowing from Student’s diagnosis. (Finding of Fact No. 87 Parents did
consent for Student to be evaluated for ESS, because they were afraid Student would be singled out
as a special education student was unreasonable. (Findings of Fact No. 85, 88). (Finding of Fact No.
88). If Student had been found eligible for the EES program, Student would have been able to
receive special education and services very similar to those provided by the Spire school in a far less
restrictive environment. (Findings of Fact 86 and 96) Thus, reimbursement for the 2015-2016
school year is not appropriate due to the refusal to consent to the evaluation for ESS and the
unreasonableness of Parents actions in choosing not to cooperate with the District in its efforts to
ﬁnd the least restrictive placement for their child.

8. Parents request as equitable relief two years of education at the Spire School, reimbursement of
private tutoring, reimbursement of counseling provided by Dr. Heitzman in 2015—2016 and
reimbursement of the costs incurred in hiring the educational consultant. Parents’ request for tutoring
reimbursement is not appropriate. The tutor’s time was not spent in direct instruction in executive
functioning skills and most of it was spent assisting Student in the completion of homework.
(Finding of Fact No. 50) Some of the sessions were for SSAT test preparation. (1d.) The tutor was
not making up for the work that had not been done by the case managers, who were putting an
enormous amount of time and effort into Student’s program. Rather tutor was relieving Parent of the
task of helping Student with her homework at the end of the day. (Finding of Fact N0. 50) Fuither,
the tutor’s level of assistance was counter to goal of Student being able to internalize strategies and
fade support. The equities weigh against an award of two years of prospective placement at the
Spire School, where Parents have interfered with the District’s attempts to offer a program with
similar services to Spire in a far less restrictive environment and as such a prospective placement is
not awarded. (P—88) Dr. Heitzman was engaged as a therapist for Student as a result of Student’s
unsuccessful experience in a summer camp. (Finding of Fact No. 52). T0 the extent Parents sought
out therapy to help Student address issues that manifested themselves during her summer experience,

21

 

July 21, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0165

reimbursement is not warranted. For no clear reason, the educational consultant chose not to consult
with anyone in the Fairﬁeld Public School system when conducting her review of Student’s
educational records. (F inding of Fact No. 80) The educational consultant critiqued the rigor of the
proposed program based on Parent report, which Was in turn based on hearsay from other parents.
(Finding of Fact No. 70) These choices call into question the foundation of conclusions reached in
the report. Parents had clearly conferred with the educational consultant and obtained her
recommendations prior to the issuing of her report on a Saturday, as evidenced by Parent’s
enrollment in Spire School the following Tuesday. T0 the extent the report is deﬁcient and codiﬁed a
decision that was already made by the Parents, reimbursement for this expenditure is not warranted.
