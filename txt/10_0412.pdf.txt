FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
An expedited special education hearing in the above-captioned ma
tter was requested by Achievement First Hartford Academy (&#64257;Achievem
ent First&#64258;) via Request for Impartial Special 
Education Hearing dated May 6, 2010.
1 It was received by the Due Process Unit on May 6. The case was initially assigned to another Hearing Officer who recused herself due to a relationship with one of the parties. The case was assigned to the undersigned Hearing Officer on May 10. On May 10, the Hearing Officer issued a Memora
ndum and Order outlining 
the issue raised in the Request for Hearing, setting out the timelines for the case, and sc
heduling a pre-hearing conference on May 18 and scheduling hearing dates on May 25 and 26. The issue raised is whether Student&#8482;s high level of impulsivity and extreme behaviors require
 placement in an Interim Alternative Educational 
Setting (&#64257;IAES&#64258;) to maintain the safety of 
Student and others in the school setting. On May 13, Achievement First file
d a Motion to Join the Hartford Board of Education (&#64257;Board of Education&#64258;) as a party, claiming it
 to be the local education agency responsible for Student&#8482;s special education program. On May 14, the Hearing Officer 
issued a scheduling order permitting the Board of 
Education to file a response to 
the motion and relaying to them the May 10 Memorandum and Order.
