This Hearing Officer was assigned to the due process case on March 4.  A prehearing conference was scheduled on March 11.  On Saturday, March 5, the Father faxed the Hearing Officer a letter and asked to postpone the prehearing conference until he obtained counsel.  The request was denied by letter dated March 7.  On March 8, Atty. Littlefield filed an appearance for the Board.  On that date, a second letter was faxed from the Father stating that the Parents were unable to retain counsel prior to March 11 and, therefore, wished to withdraw the hearing request.  On March 9, the Hearing Officer wrote to the parties and advised them that the prehearing conference would be canceled and that the case would be dismissed without prejudice.   The Father was advised that he should contact the State Department of Education directly regarding the scheduled March 21 mediation date.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  It is ordered that this case is dismissed without prejudice.
