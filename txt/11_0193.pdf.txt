April 19» 201 1 Final Decision (ind Order I l-Ol93

This Final Decision and Order sets forth the Hearing Ofﬁcer‘s ﬁndings of fact and conclusions ot‘
law. To the extent that ﬁndings of fact actually represent conclusions of iaw, they should be so
considered, and vice versa. For reference, see SAS Insﬂmle. Inc.. v, S & H Compuler Systems,
Inc, 605 F. Supp. 816, (March 6, i985); and Bonnie Am: F. v. C(Illallen lndependem School
District, 835 F. Supp. 340 (SD. Tex. 1993).

Any motions not previously ruled upon are hereby denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT:

1 t The Student was ﬁve years old at the time the Due Process hearing commenced and was
attending the Board’s preschool program at Charles Barnum School.

2. The Student was diagnosed with a moderate to severe bilateral hearing loss when he was
two months old. He now wears bilateral hearing aids and is unable to hear high-
frequency sounds in common speech such as “sh”, “s”, “t", and “th.” However, this
appears to be improving and the Student is making progress. (Testimony Bell, Testimony
Hailissey. Testimony Knobloeh).

3‘ The Student received Bilth to Three services from the New England Center for Hearing
Rehabilitation (NECHEAR) until age three when he was transitioned to the Board’s
special education program following a Janualy 21, 2009 PPT meeting. (Testimony
Parent; B—8, B-9,B-i3,B-15,B-20).

4. The Parents requested that NECHEAR provide the Student with his audiologieai and
aural habilitation sewices as part of his special education program. (Testimony Parent; B—

80)‘

5. The Parents provided copies ofNECHEAR evaluations to the Board prior to the Januaiy
21, 2009 PP'I‘. These contained educational reconmlendations, including acoustical
modiﬁcations to the Student’s classroom environment (Testimony Parent; Ba12, B-18).

6. The Student was placed in the Board‘s half-day preschool program for the remainder of
the 2008—09 school year following the J anuaiy 21, 2009 PPT meeting with a Teacher of
the Hearing Impaired (“THI”), special education teacher, and a speech and language
pathologist. (B—20).

7, The THI utilized a daily home/schooi communications notebook that provided the
Parents with information on the work that was completed during the school day and
speciﬁc lesson plans For the Parents to work on at home with the Student for the 2008-09
school year and ESY 2009. (Testimony Parent).

8, The Student made progress during the period of January 2009 through July 2009.
(Testimony Parent).

On December 22, 2008, J anualy S, 2009, and Jannaty ’7, 2009, the Groton Public Schools
Early Childhood Assessment evaluated the Student. Pursuant thereto, scores on (he
Battelle Developmental Inventory 2 indicated an adaptive total of 98, personal social total
of 86, communication total of 83, motor total of l l l, cognitive total of 77, and a total
score of 88, The Student’s scores on the Preschool Language Scale-4 indicated auditory
comprehension of92, expressive communication of 74, and totaI language score ofSl.
The standard scores on these evaluations have an average range between 85 and l 15.
(Testimony Hallissey, Testimony Knobloch; B-I7).

On January 21, 2009, a PPT was convened. The Student was enrolled at the Charles
Barnum School. The PPT considered the above Early Childhood Assessment and
recommended that the Student be eligible for the Integrated Preschool Program, Pursuant
thereto, the Student would have three half-day sessions per week, sixty minutes per week
of speech and language and one hour per week of services from the THT; IBP goals were
developed. The Student would use the FM system in School. An audiological evaluation
would be conducted biamulally. An auditory perceptual evaluation would be done
annually, The PPT intended to reconvene in June 2009 to review the Student’s program
and discuss ﬁnther evaluations. No other options were considered or rejected. (B20),

On June 3, 2009, a PPT was convened. The PPT recommended ESY 2009 services for
one hour per week for four weeks in the form of group speech and language to prevent
regression. (B~24).

On June 18, 2009, a PPT reconvened and recommended that the Student be provided
ESY 2009 progrannning at Nottheast Academy for four days per week for four weeks in
July. Services from the TH] would be provided one hour per day and speech and
language services one hour per week. All services would be provided in the classroom,
Fuﬂher, the Student would attend the Integrated Preschool program for four half—days per
week during the 2009~2010 school year, No other options were considered or rejected.
(8—26).

On July 15, 2009, a PPT convened to review and/or revise the IEP. Pursuant thereto, the
recommemtations were to increase services from the TH] to two hours per day during the
ESY 2009 program. No other options were considered or refused. (13-30).

Pursuant to the NECHEAR evaluation report of October 2009, wherein the speech and
language pathologist evaluated the Student’s performance during 2008-2009, the
Student’s standard score improved on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary 'I‘est (PPVT—4)
from an 85 in 2008 to a 96 i112009 which placed him “at a level within average ranges in
comparison to peers with typical hearing." The evaluation report indicated that the
Student “made over a year’s growth in his comprehension of vocabulary," On the
Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT-Z), the Student mastered skills giving him an age
equivalent score of 3 years/Z months in 2009 as compared to 2 years/l 1 months in 2008‘
Both scores in 2008 and 2009 were “in the average ranges when compared to peers with
typical hearing.“ On the SPELT-2, the Student was unable to complete the test in 2008
but was able to complete the test in 2009 and received a standard score of 71. On the
Preschool Language ScaIe-S, the Student’s auditory age equivalent scores improved from

l year/8 months in Janualy 2009 to 3 years/ 1 month in October 2009. Expressive
communication improved from 2 yeal‘s/Z months to 2 years/9 months. Total Language
score improved from 1 year/l 1 months in January 2009 to 3 years/O months in October
2009. (Testimony Haliissey, B48, 13-37, 8-38).

in Octobe1'2009, the Developmental Reassessment determined that the Student’s scores
had improved in several important respects. BDI-2 cognitive domain had improved from
a standard score of 77 to 87, which was within the average range; personal social
improved from 86 to 96 (low to solidly average); and conununication improved from 83
to 92 with no gap between receptive and expressive language subtests (low to solidly
average). (Testimony Knobloch; B86).

Pursuant to the October 2009 Developmental Reassessment, the Student maintained his
position relative to his peers by maintaining the same standard scores as demands
increased conuucnsurate with age expectations, but also “eiosed the gap” by increasing
his standard score. (Testimony Knobloch; 13-36).

On October 19, 2009, a PPT was convened to Review or Revise the 1131’ and Review
Evaluations. The Parent repented that the Student’s communication skills were regressing
and read a statement outlining the reasons that he was requesting placement at CRBC.
The Board rejected the Parents‘ request for a change in placement based upon the
education performance and the evaluation results. (Testimony Parent; B-39).

The October 19, 2009 PPT reviewed the results 01‘ the above re-evaiuations. it
recommended increasing the Student‘s preschool program to ﬁve half-days per week
and increase the sewices from the TH] to one half— hour per day 0125 hours per week

(B-39).

On December 8, 2009, a PPT was convened to plan evaiuations/re-evaluations. The
Parents requested an outside evaluation by a qualiﬁed educator of deaf and hearing
impaired children. The Board offered Dr. Lisa Kuntz to complete the Board’s
psychological evaluation. The Parent renewed the previous request for the CREC
placement. (B-44, B46).

The December 8, 2009 PPT recommended that the Board complete developmental,
social, communication and audiological evaluations. The Board recommended that a
release oi‘inf'ormation be provided to Dr. Kuntz to consult with NECHEAR, (13—44).

The Board retained the Connecticut Children‘s Medicai Center (CCMC) to complete the
Board’s audiologicai evaluation and speech and language evaluation. (B—47, B-49).

The CCMC Audiologist repmted that the Student’s hearing loss was connnunjcatively
and educationally signiﬁcant which impacted conversational speech, that the Student
mishears information without realizing it, that he strains to hear what people are saying
and may experience fatigue as a result of his increased efforts to hear. (B-47).

The CCMC Speech and Language Pathologist reported the results from standardized
assessments and concluded that the Student’s articulation skills were moderately delayed,
he had difﬁculty monitoring the level of his voice, his receptive language skills were
mildly delayed and his expressive language skills were moderately delayed; one hour per
week of medically based speech and language services was recommended. (B-47, B-49).

On January 13, 2010, January 27, 2010 and February 22, 2010, Dr. Lisa Kuntz performed
a multiple day comprehensive evaluation ofthe Student. This evaluation included, but
was not limited to, classroom observation, Woodcock—Johnson 11], Tests of Achievement,
Brie!" Battery, Bender Visual—Motor Gestait Test, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales
Second Edition (Vinclantl 11), Survey interview with the Parents, Teacher Rating Form,
Mental Status Checklist for Chi1dren, Meadow-Kendah Socia1~Emotional Assessment
Inventory for Deaf and Hearing Impaired Students ~ Preschool form, Human Figure
Drawing, 1*louse—Trce~Person Drawing, Drawing of Choice, Behavior Assessment System
for Childrcn-Second Edition (BASC-2), Structured Developmental History with the
Parents; and hiterviews with the Parents, Ms. Knoblock the Special Education Preschool
teacher, Ms. Bell the TH], the Audiologist, and NECHEAR. (Testimony Kuntz; P—22).

Pursuant to Dr. Kuntz “[A]s would be expected when meeting a stranger, [the Student]
was initiahy minimaHy responsive. . . as he became more comfortable [the Student]
relaxed and he was quite talkative. His range of affect was appropriate and he presented
as happy and cheerful . . was cooperative.” (P-22).

Dr. Kuntz opined that the Student‘s skills were within the age level expectations or
average range. Dr. Kuntz also opined that the Student’s classroom was not speciﬁcally
designed For the needs 01a child with a hearing impairment and reeonunended acoustical
modiﬁcations to the classroom. Further, that the Student required certain direct teaching
strategies for academic and soeim skills because he did not learn such skills incidentally.

(Testimony Kuntz; 13—50).

The Student was continuing to make steady progress in the Board’s program through
February 2010. On the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement, the Student scored at
age and grade appropriate levels for a child of his age at the preschool 1eve1, indicating
that he was gaining appropriate pre-academic skills in the Board’s preschool program.
(Testimony Kuntz; B~50).

On the VineIand 11, a developmental interview completed by the Parents and teachers
with Dr. Kuntz, the Student scored in the average range on a11 measured skills, including
receptive and expressive communication. (Testimony Kuntz; 13-50).

Dr. Kuntz observed the Student in school and endorsed his program for the 2009-2010
school year as appropriate to meet his needs. This included appropriate technologies of
an FM system, Visual supports, services of both a T111 and speech and language
pathologist, and a consultation with an audiologist for further analysis of the acoustic
enviromnent 01‘ the school setting. (Testimony Kuntz; B—SO).

There were no more than twelve children in the preschool classroom, and the typicni
peers provided excellent speech role models. (Testimony Dr, Kuntz; B—SO).

The audiologicnl consultation was obtained following the receipt of Dr. Kuntz’ repent,
and the recommendations contained therein were implemented in terms oi“ reducing
ambient noise, obtaining a new sound ﬁeld receiver unit and adding acoustic
improvements to the “Focus room“ where the Student received one to one instruction.
(Testimony Knobloch, Testimony Doolittle; 8—53).

The Parents provided the Board with an undated NECI-TEAR Auditory perceptual
evaluation report which appears to have been pelfortlted on or about April 2, 2010. That
report indicated that the Student hears approximately eighty-two percent (82%) of
individual sounds with his hearing aids and approxinmtely eighty-nine per cent (89%) of
such sounds with an FM system. NECHEAR provided educational recolmnendations
including the use of an FM system and acoustical modifications to the Student’s
classroom in order to reduce ambient noise and increase the auditory signal. (13—50, 8—52).

On April 26, 2010, the Board convened a PPT meeting to review or revise the TEP,
conduct the annual review, and review evaluations. (857).

During the April 26‘ 2010 PPT, the Parents disagreed with Dr. Kuntz’s report and
requested an independent education evaluation (IEE) by an educator of children with
hearing impairments. The Parents disagreed with the repotts of progress and they
requested placement at the CREC program for ESY 2010 and the 2010-1 1 school year.
The Board denied those requests. (Testimony Parent; 13—57).

The April 26, 2010 PPT recommended that (1) CCMC complete a full Speech and
Language Evaluation, not selected subtests, and that CCMC also be asked to complete a
classroom observation in the Classroom; (2) a new IEP be implemented for the 2010-
2011 school year in the Integrated Preschool Program for ﬁve mornings per week; (3) one
hour of speech and language instmction per week and thhty minutes daily of sewices
from the THI be provided; (4) the Student attend ESY 2010 within the district with the
summer program including one hour of daily sewices from the TH! and typical peer role
models; (5) an Anttiological Evaluation be provided at Board expense by Pequot
Atltlioiogical Center; and (6) an enviromnental evaluation be conducted by Pequot
Audiologicai to assess the classroom environment. The PPT denied the request for an
IEE for a ﬁmctional listening assessment by 3 TH]. (B—S7).

Dr, Patterson evaluated the Student on May 24, 2010, and prepared an TEE report that was
sent to the Board’s attorney on June 30, 2010. Dr. Patterson had not met the Student
prior to that (lay and “did not know him at all." She had not obsewcd the Student in any
other settings — such as home or school. (Testimony Patterson; P-35).

Dr. Patterson had no infornmtion regarding the program offered by the Board. She had
never observed the Student within the program. Obsewing the chiid in the school setting
is usually part ot’Dr. Patterson’s standard evaluation. Dr. Patterson did not request an
opponunity to (10 so. Dr. Patterson did not speak with school staff, including the TH],

She relied upon conversations with the Parent but not direct contact with the School, Dr,
Patterson did not request or review any school records. (Testimony Patterson).

Dr. Patterson did not perform any standard testing but relied upon the tests of others. Dr.
Patterson believed that there was sufficient information in the snmmaty results presented
in summaries by other evaluators such that administering another standardized test was
not going “to be adding substantially more information” to her observations. (Testimony
Patterson).

The Parent was present during Dr, Patterson’s entire evaluation. The presence of a parent
can change a child’s behavior, (Testimony Patterson).

The Student presented as “shy" on the day of Dr. Patterson’s evaluation. Testing may be
impacted if a child is newous. During the evaluation, Di: Patterson involved the Parent
in the evaluation as the Student was getting tired and she was concerned she “was not
getting the best from him” and thought “someone familiar with him such as the father"
should assist. (Testimony Patterson).

Dr. Patterson assessed the Student‘s spoken language, auditory perception, auditory
discrimination, and speech. Dr. Patterson concluded that the Student had a delay in
spoken language development compared to his peers in receptive and expressive
vocabulary. Futther, she concluded that he had a signiﬁcant gap in his receptive and
expressive ianguage skills based upon her review of four subtests out of six subtests
administered in the original CELF-2 test by the CCMC speech and language pathologist’s
report (B-49). (Testimony Patterson; P-35).

During the hearing, Dr, Patterson corrected her evaluation and explained that she erred by
misinterpreting cettain testing results when she represented that the Student had a
significant gap in his receptive and expressive language skills. (Testimony Patterson).

Dr. Patterson concluded that the Student did not make one year of progress in one year,
that his test scores in expressive language had declined, the Student has a moderate delay
in articulation skills, the use of hearing aids and an FM system alone were insufﬁcient,
and that he required the daily sewices oi‘an audiologist to manage his access to sound.
Dr. Patterson provided several educational recommendations including a full day program
with hearing peers to provide excellent language models. She further recommended
regular parent guidance sessions to assist them with stimulating the Student’s auditony
and spoken language development, small group instruction with a THI, developing oral
communication goals to encourage the Student to speak frequently in class, having the
TH] monitor the Student’s expressive language abilities and oral communication during
play and learning activities, having the THI frequently check the Student’s understanding
and establishing individual objectives for spoken language through listening. (Testimony
Patterson; B-62)t

On June 6, 20l0, NECHEAR completed an Aural Habiiitation Assessment, :1 copy of
which was provided to the Board. Pursuant thereto, NECHEAR reported that “it is
wonthwhite to note that [the Student] tends to act shyly anti revert back to jargening when

he is in new enviromnents and is unfamiliar with people . . and will often not take
chances it‘ he feels that he will be unsuccessful,“ (B-GS).

The J une 6, 2010 NECHEAR evaluation determined that the Student made approximately
one year’s growth in one year’s time by direct comparison to the prior year’s evaluation.
However, in order to close the gap between his clu‘onological age and his language age,
the Student needed to make more than one year’s growth in one year’s time. The
evaluation ﬁuther noted that while the Student’s hearing aids provide him with excellent
access to sound in an ideal listening environment, he still made speech perception errors,
required an acoustically treated room, an FM system, and individual therapies to occur in
a quiet environment to provide him with the best access to the acoustical signal. Auditory
memoty was an area of concern. The evaluator provided several educational
recommendations. (B-6S),

Pequot Health Center prepared a classroom obsewalion report that is dated April 5, 20l0
and date stamped as received by the Board on May 27, 2010. That report made
rccotmnendalions l‘or acoustical modiﬁcations to the Student‘s classroom for reducing
ambient noise and developing a focus room for direct instruction. (B-6S),

The CREC Preschool program is a full day program from 9:00 am. to 3:00 pm. it
consists of fomteen children with hearing impairments and ﬁfty-eight typical children.
Each classroom is comprised of forty percent children with hearing impairments and sixty
per cent typical children. The classes are taught by a certiﬁed TH] who works with each
student individually up to thirty minutes daily and directs other classroom staff. There is
also an Early Childhood Instructor, Assistant Early Childhood lnstmetor and
paraprofessional. Full time audiologists and audiology technicians are on site. The
classrooms are acoustically modiﬁed to reduce ambient noise and the classrooms have
sound ﬁelds and FM systems that are compatible with a child’s hearing aids. (Testimony

Cole).

CREC accepts children with other disabilities in the preschool program. It is required
that all ol‘ these children have hearing impairment as a primary disability. They may have
other disabilities, too. There are “quite a number of kids with sensory problems, gross
motor, ﬁne motor, and autistic-like behaviors. Some are eventually diagnosed. The ratio
ot'children with disabilities to children who are typical is approximately 60 percent
without disabilities and 40 percent with disabilities, This may vary depending on
morning or afternoon or day of the week. Some days it is greater.” (Testimony Cole),

Dr. Cole did not assess the Student but reviewed educational records and reports from
CCMC and NECHEAR, the IEP, the Board’s language samples from January 20l l and
Dr. Kuntz’s report. (T estimony Cole).

Based upon her review of the educational records and video (P-44), Dr. Cole opined that
the Student and his needs were similar to students at CREC. (Testimony Cole).

Dr. Cole has never met the Student nor has she attended any PPT meetings. (Testimony
Cole).

On July 28, 2010, the Board convened a PPT to review evaluation reports including Dr,
Patterson’s report, the Pequot Audiology report date stamped May 27, 2010, the
NECHBAR Aural Habilitation report and an amended CCMC speech evaluation report.
(B-65, B-66, B-68, 8—70, P—30, P35)

The July 28, 2010 PPT added a self-advocacy goat and a pragmatic language goal to the
Student‘s IEP. (B~70).

The July 28, 2010 PPT recommended (1) revision of the Student’s IEP goals and
objectives for comnumicntion and an added goal for conversational speech and
pragnmtics; (2) add environmental modiﬁcations to the classroom and focus room to
reduce noise level and provide a focus room for individual or small group instmction; (3)
provide full day preschool programming by having the Student attend both the morning
and aﬁemoon half-day sessions commencing with the 2010—20] 1 school year; (4) one
hour per day of services from the TH]; (5) three one-half hour sessions per week from the
speech and language pathologist; (6) on site consultation by the Pequot Audiologist in the
fall to assess the environmental conditions and instructional spaces; (7) the TH! conduct
at least one training session with the classroom paraprofessionals and the speech and
language pathologist in the fail on best practices for instructing the Student; and (8) the
Board pay for Dr. Patterson’s evaluation. (3—70).

The July 28, 2010 PPT refused the Parents’ request For a change of placement for ESY
2010 and the 20|0.20| 1 school year based upon the Student‘s educational pertbrmance,
the evaluation results and that the program was appropriate and the least restrictive
euviromnent for the Student. (B—70).

The Student made meaningful progress during P,SY 2010. (Testimony Brasﬁeld; 13—71,
8-72).

The 2010-201 1 program consists of a full day, ﬁve days per week program with the
Student attending and participating in both the morning and afternoon preschool hatt—(tay
programs with an oppommity for speech and language therapy, He has “Lunch Bunch"
with nendisabted kindergattcn peers between the two sessions. The concepts addressed
in the morning and afternoon sessions are the same, but the teacher varies the activities
between the two sessions so that the Student is not bored. He has multiple opportunities
to practice the same concepts in different activities (Testimony Knohloeh, Testimony
Bell, Testimony Kuntz),

During the “Lunch Bunch" lunchtime group, which is run by the speech and language
pathologist and a paraprofessional, the Student has an oppommity to practice receptive,
expressive, and pragmatic communication skills in real-iife conversations with peers over

The Student‘s preschool class consists of the Student and typical peer roles models in a

The preschool teacher sends home regular weekly communication sheets to the parents
detailing the units to be addressed in the coming week, including vocabulaay to be
reinforced, songs to be sung, and reinforcement activities. (Testimony Knobioch; B-84,
P—49),

The Student’s hearing aid function is checked on a daily basis by the THI or the Speech
and Language Pathologist. The Board has a contract with Pequot Audiology if issues
arise. (Testimony Bell, T estiinony Hallissey, Testimony Knobloch).

The Student has made meaningful progress. (Testimony Bell, Testimony Knobtoch,
Testimony Haiiissey; 8—77, B-78, B-85),

Currently, the Student receives one hour per day from the TH] which includes t‘orly~ﬁve
minutes in the focus room receiving aural habititation therapy and ﬁﬁeen minutes in the
general classroom in addition to the services provided by the Speech and Language
Pathologist, (Testimony Bell, Testimony Hallissey)

The Board’s program is an integrated preschool program where the Student’s elussroom
teacher is a certiﬁed special education teacher, The Student’s entire teaching team, which
includes the special education teacher, THI, and Speech and Language Pathologist,
consult with one another and coordinate teaching practices daily for the benefit of the
Student. There are no more than twelve children in the classroom and the Student has
typical peer role models all year round, including in the ESY program. (Testimony
Knobloeh, Testimony Doolittle, Testimony Brasﬁeid).

Lisa Knobloch is a State Ceitiﬁed Special Education Teacher and has worked in the
integrated preschool program at the Groton Public Schools since 2001. She was the
Student’s special education teacher for the 2008-2009, 2009-2010, and 2010-201 1 school

years. (Testimony Knobloch).

The integrated preschool model is such that there are seven students with special needs in
the morning class with six typical peers. Since some of the students attend only three
days per week and some of the students attend four days per week, there are typically six
typical peers and six special needs students. in the afternoon, there are six special needs
children and six peer models. There is a speech and language pathologist, an
occupational therapist, a THI, and paraprofessionals. Regular team meetings are held on
Wednesday afternoons when students are not present, as well as at other intewals.
(Testimony Knobloch).

The Student’s progress has been vcty similar to that oftypical three year olds in the
classroom. The Student has had a positive experience. He started out veiy quiet and shy,
He made progress academically, was talking more, inereased'in his sentences and was
playing more naturally and more comfortably. (Testimony Knobloch),

The evaluation by Dr. Kuntz is consistent with daily obsewalions by Ms. Knobloeh of the
Student in the classroom. (Testimony Knobloch).

There have been changes and modiﬁcations to the ciassroom to meet the Student‘s needs.
These include an FM system and the sound field system, use of the Smart Board and a
maximum of‘ 12 children in the eiassroom. Ms. Knobioch works in the classroom and
takes small groups to an outside area, either in the focus room or in the hallway to
minimize the noise both in the classroom and in the small groups. They also replaced the
air conditioning system so that it would be quiet, installed new lighting to avoid ambient
noise, and added the focus room, which is a small room with carpeting and soundproofing
such as bulletin boards on the walls causing the focus room to he very quieL ('i‘estimony

Knobioch).

During the 2008-2009 school year, the Student made meaningful progress. (Testimony
Knobloeh, Testimony Pm‘enl; B-20, 13—28, B-38).

The Student made meaningful progress during ESY 2009. (8-29, B-32).

When the Student returned to the classroom in fall 2009, he had maintained his skill
leveis from the previous school year. (Testimony Knobloch),

During the 2009-2010 school year, the Board’s program provided FAPE to the Student
and the Student made meaningful progress. (Testimony Knobloch, Testimony Haiiisey;
8—36, B—38, B-39. B-44, B-70, 13-77, 8—81, 1343?».

The 2010 ESY program provided FAPE to the Student and he made meaningful progress.
(Testimony Knobioch, Testimony Hallisey; Testimony Brasﬁeid; B~71, B-72, B-77).

During the 2010-201 1 school year, the Board’s program provided FAPB to the Student
and he has made meaningful progress. (Testimony1-Ia11isey,Testimony Knobloeh,
Testimony Doolitt1e; 8-77, 8-78, 13-81, B-83).

The Student resides in Groton, Connecticut. CREC is located in Wethersfieid,
Connecticut. Travei time is likely to be approximntciy one hour in each direction. The
Student would be transported by some type of vehicle, such as a minibus, and it is not
permitted to travel over ﬁfty-ﬁve mi1es per hour pursuant to Board policy, Weather
conditions and/or traffic may increase the travel time. (Testimony Ms. Doolittle).

The Student has made many friends and is quite “popular” amongt his peers. Based upon
the Student’s current progress, he is expected to be transitioned to Kindergaiten for the
201 1-2012 school year. Many of his current friends and peers are also anticipated to be
transitioned with the Student to kindergarten in the Groton Public Schools in the 121111
(Testimony Knobloeh, Testimony Doolittle).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:

1 .

The Student qualiﬁes for, and is entitied to receive, a free and appropriate public
education with special education and related services under the provisions ot‘state and
federal laws. CGS §10-76, et seq. and the Individuals with Disnbiiities Education Act

(“IDEA") 20 UtS.C. §140], el .qu1

12

April 19, 2011 Final Decision and Order I 1-0193

2‘ IDEA opens the door of public education to children with disabilities. Board of Educ. 0f
the Hendrick Hmlxon Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rmvley, 458 U.S. 176, 192 (1982). Under
IDEA, a local education association ("LEA”), such as the Board, must provide to each
qualifying student a free appropriate public education (“FAPE”) in the least restrictive
env'u‘omnent (“LRE”), including special education and related services. 20 U.S.C.
§1401(18).

3. The purpose of IDEA is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them
FAPE that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their
unique needs and prepare them for further education, employment and independent living
and to “ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are
protected . t ." 2O U.S.C. §1400 (d)(1).

41 An “appropriate” education is one that is reasonably calculated to confer some
educational beneﬁt. See Board ofEdua of live Hendrick Hudson Cenll'al Sch. Dis! v.
Rawley, 458 U.S. 176, 206-7 (1982); ii’alczak v, Florida Union Free Sch Dis/. 142 RM

119.130 (2d C112 1998).

5. “Special Education“ means: “specially designed instmetion at no cost to parents to meet
the unique needs ofa child with a disability." 201).S1C, §I401(25).

6, “Related Sewices" means: transponation, and such developmental, corrective, and other
snpponive services (including speech/language pathology and audiology services,
psychological sewices, physical and occupational therapy, recreation, including
therapeutic recreation, socia] work sewices, counseling services, including rehabilitation
counseling, orientation and mobility sewices, and medical services, except that such
medical sewices shall be for diagnostic and evaluation purposes only) as may be required
to assist a child with a disability to beneﬁt from special education, including the early
identiﬁcation and assessment ofdisabiing conditions in children. 20 U.S.C. §1401(22)1

7. The standard for determining whether FAPE has been provided is set fotth in Rowley.
.s-uprcn The two-pronged inquiry is ﬁrst, whether the procedura1 requirements of IDEA
have been met and second, whether the iEP is “reasonably calculated to enable the child
to receive educational beneﬁts." Rowley, supra, at 206-207.

8. The second prong 01‘ Rowley requires a ﬁnding that the 1131’ is "reasonably calculated to
enable the child to receive educational beneﬁt." The Supreme Court has made clear that
"appropriate" under the IDEA does not require that the school districts "nmximize the
potential of handicapped children." I'Valczak v. Florida Union Free School District, 142
F.3d 199, 130 (2d. Cir.1998)), citing Rowley, supra. Rather, school districts are required
to provide, as the "basic ﬂoor of opponunity . , . access to specialized services which are
individually designed to provide educational beneﬁt to the handicapped child." Rattvley.
supra, 458 U.S. at 201; see also KP. v, Juzwic, 891 F. Supp. 703, 718 (D.Gomt, 1995)
(Goat of IDEA is to provide access to public education for disabled students, not to
maximize a special education child's potential). hi this Circuit, the Court of Appeals has
said that the proper gauge for determining educational progress is "whether the
educational program provided for a child is reasonably calculated to allow the child to

13

April 19,201 1 Final Decision and Order ll‘0193

receive ”meaningﬁil‘ educational benefits.” Ms. B. u Milford Board of Educalion, 103
F.3d 1 I 14, 1120(2<1Cir.t997)‘ The Court of Appeals has also cautioned that meaningful
educational benefits are "not evelything that might be thought desirable by loving
parents." Tucker v. Bay Shore Union Free School Dish, 873 F.2d 563, 567 (2nd

Ch: 1989). "Clearly, Congress did not intend that a school system could discharge its duty
under the [lDEA] by providing a program that produces some minimal academic
advancement, no matter how trivial." Hull v. Vance County Rd. ofEtluc., 774 F.2d 629,
636 (4th Cir.1985). "Ofcourse, a child's academic progress must be viewed in light of
the limitations imposed by the child's disability." Ms. B. v. Milford, supra at 1121. When
determining the appropriateness of a given placement courts will also consider evidence
ol‘a student's progress in that placement. As set forth hereinabove, at all relevant times,
the great weight of the evidence establishes that the Student has made meaningful
progress. Although he still has delays and requires special education services in order to
progress and reach his goals, the totality of the record does not support that these services
are better provided by CREC rather than the Groton Public Schools.

In order to ensure that the balance of sewices required to meet these goals is speciﬁcally
ﬁtted to the particular child, the IDEA requires that each child receive an Individualized
Education Program. The lEl’ is intended to be "the result of collaborations between
parents, educators, and the representatives of the school district," Lillbask v. Connecticul
Dep'l QfEduc. 397 F.3d 77, 2005 US. App. LEXIS 1655 (2d CinzFeb, 2, 2005). While
the IEP does not have to maximize the child's educational potential it must provide
"meaningful" oppontunlties and the possibility for more than “trivial advancement."
Wa/czak 142 F.3d at 130.

The lEP serves as the centerpiece ot‘a student’s entitlement to special education under the
IDEA l-lom‘g v. Doe, 484 US. 305, 31 l (1988). The primaty safeguard is the obligatory
development of an TBP which must contain a statement 01‘ the child's current educational
performance, including how his disability affects his involvement and progress in the
general curriculum, and a statement of "measurable annual goals, including academic and
functional goals, designed to (aa) meet the child's needs that result from the child's
disability to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education
curriculum; and (bb) meet each of the child's other educational needs that result from the
child's disability" 20 U.S.C. §l4l4(<l)(1)(A)(ii); 34 CFR §3001320(a)(2)(1); RolandM.

in developing an 1131’, the PPT must consider the strengths of the child, the concerns of
the parents, the results of the initial or most recent evaluations, and the academic,
developmental, and Functional needs ot‘the child. 34 CFR §300.324(a)(l). Counts must
also consider whether the program is "individualized on the basis of the student's
assessment and performance" when determining the appropriateness ot‘an lEP, See /t.Sl
v. Board q/Educalion quesI Hal'ljbrd, 35 lDELR 179 (D,Cotm. 2001), afj'd 47 Fed.

Here, there have been multiple PPTS wherein the team reviewed testing, perfornmnce,
and revised the EP on multiple occasions based upon the Student’s assessments and

performance.

The IEP must set forth goals and objectives which provide a mechanism to determine
whether the placement and sewiees are enabling the child to make educational progress.
20 U.S.C. §1401(a)(20). Connecticut courts have determined that in order for an IBP to
be found appropriate, it must provide more than mere trivial advancement, it must be one
that is " 1 i t likely to produce progress, not regress.” Mrs. B. v, Milford B,O.E., 103 F,2d
1 1 14, 1 121 (2d Cir 1997), The student‘s capabilities, intellectual progress and what the
LEA has offered must be considered along with grade promotions and test scores in
determining whether the program offered is reasonably calculated to confer a nontrivial or
meaningful educational beneﬁt to the child. See. Hal] v. Vance County Bd. ofEd. 774
F.2d 629, 635 (1985). Objective factors such as passing marks and advancement from
grade to grade can be indicators of meaningful educational beneﬁts but are not in and of
themselves dispositive. See. Mrs. B. v, Milford B(I. q/‘Ed. 103 F.3d 1120, (2d Cir. 1997).

Procedural safeguards are set forth in 20 U.S.C. §1415 and 34 CFR §§300.500, el seq.
Failure by the Board to develop an 1131’ in accordance with procedures mandated by
1DBA, in and of itself, can be deemed a denial of FAPE1 ItmamlaJ. ex rel Annette .l, v.
Clark C0tlIl/ySc/1.DiS/.. 267 F.3d 877, 9th Cir (2001).

A Board may not predetermine a placement for a student with a disability and must come
to the table with an open mind and consider the unique needs of the child. Deal v.
Hamillon County Rd. ofEtI.L 42 IDELR 109 (6"‘ Cir. 2004) Palticipation of Parents must
be more than a mere form; it must be meaningful. WG, 960 F.2d at 1485; see also Knox
CounlySc/1.. 315 F.3d at 694-95. The Board in this instance reviewed all of the
information provided by the Parents and sent a team from the School who were familiar
with the Student to observe the CREC program ﬁrst hand. Although the team did not
agree with the Parents’ proposed placement, it did nonetheless note the CREC program
and imp1emented many aspects of that program, including modiﬁcations to the classroom

The Board has the burden oi‘proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the program
for the 2009~2010, ESY 2010, and 2010—201 1 school years was appropriate. RCSA §10—
76h-l4(a). See also, Walczak v, Florida Union Free Sch. Dist, 142 FM 119, 122 (2d
Cir. 1998). The Board met its burden of proof. Indeed, the Board presented the
testimony of the Student’s special education teacher who has observed the Student for the
2009-2010 and 2010-201 1 school years, the ESY 2010 teacher, and the speech and
tanguage pathologist who has worked with the Student. The Board also presented the
testimony of Dr. Kuntz who performed multiple day comprehensive independent
objective testing, observed the Student on multiple occasions, consulted with the school
staff, obtained information from school staff and the Parents, reviewed records, and other
testing as well as patticipatcd in the PPT. The Board also submitted multiple exhibits by
evaluators and consultants. Conversely, the Parent relied upon the Parent’s testimony and
an evaluation performed by Dr. Patterson in May 2010, The evaluation by Dr. Patterson
was not reliable in that D1: Patterson did not review school records and could offer no

15

April I9. 201 1 Final Decision and Order 1 10193

explanation for not doing so. Dr. Patterson admitted that obsewing the Student in the
school setting was normal practice but did not do so. She performed minimal testing of
her own of the Student’s performance and relied upon her interpretation) of the testing of
others. To that extent, Dr. Patterson had to correct her report during the hearing because
she had incorrectly concluded that there was a “significant gap" in the Student’s receptive
and expressive language and realized during the hearing that this was an error. Moreover,
multiple evaluators noted that the Student is initially shy and not very responsive. Dix
Patterson admittedly could not obtain adequate cooperation from the Student so she
utilized the father to assist her with the evaluation while at the same time admitting that
the presence 01‘ the father could affect the reliability of the testing results. Multiple
witnesses who were familiar with the Student also viewed the video of Dr. Patterson‘s
evaluation and noted the Student to be tired, not fully cooperating, and not an accurate
representation of the Student’s abilities.

The Student’s IEP included ESY due to his being unavailable for learning during the
school year. Generally, ESY is provided for a Student in order to prevent the amount of
gains achieved by a Student from being jeopardized SIm/en/ v, Preston 8. 0. E1 CT DOE
Case No. 06-109, p. 10 (12/27/06); MM. byDJi/I. & EM. v, Sch. Dist. ofGrcenvf/Ie

38 [DELR 261 (4th Cir. 2003). An ESY program cannot be arbitrarily limited by the
Board. l(/.; 34 CFR §300.309 (a)(3)(ii). The Student made meaningful progress during his
2010 ESY program. When the Student returned to the fall school year program he had
not only maintained his level of ability but had progressed. Hence, the 2010 ESY
program provided FAPE.

Pursuant to 34 CFR §300.342 (a), at the beginning of each school year the public agency
shall have an 1131’ in effect for each child with a disability within its jurisdiction, The
Board complied with this and each of the referenced IEPs above identiﬁed a program that

provided FAPE‘

The least restrictive environment does not tnlmp the requirement that a chiid receive
FAPE. If a child’s placement does not provide "signiﬁcant learning” or “meaningful
beneﬁt" to the child, and a more restrictive program is likely to provide such beneﬁt, then
the child is entitled to be placed in that more restrictive program. See Dlghlon~ltel1obolh
Regional Sch. Dist. 4 ECLPR 721 (SBA MS 2006). Here, the program proposed by the
Parents is a more restrictive program, does not afford the Student the opportunity to have
the optimum uondisnbled peers as role models and involves transponting the student
approximately two hours per day alone in a vehicle, exclusive of trafﬁc and weather
conditions which could increase this time and could be time spent learning in the
classroom. Further, the Student has progressed with ceitain other students whereby he
has formed strong social relationships. The Student is expected to be transitioned with
his peers and friends into Kindergarten in the fall 201 1‘ Since the current placement
provides signiﬁcant learning and a meaningful beneﬁt to the Student, there is no basis
upon which to place him in a more restrictive environment. The Board has extensively
investigated modiﬁcations for the Student‘s beneﬁt, including alterations and
modifications to the classroom. The Board did this both by way of consultants and

visiting the CREC program. The Board implemented all recommendations. Setting aside
that the Board’s program provided FAPE to the Student, the CREC program does not
provide a greater opportunity to the Student so as to warrant his placement in a more
restrictive environment.

The federal law requires that handicapped children be educated with their non-disabled
peers to the maximum extent appropriate. 20 1.1.8.0 §1412(a)(5); 34 CFR §300.1 14.
However, a district must make any placement and service decisions for a child based on
their individual needs. 20 U.S.C. 1401(29); 34 CFR§300.39, see also Obem’ v. Board of
Education ofBorough ofClemem‘on School Dislricl, 995 F.2d 1204,1214 (3d Cir. 1993)
A comparison must be made between the educational beneﬁts the child will receive in the
regular classroom and the beneﬁts the child will receive in a segregated program. [(1 at
1220. A segregated setting may be the most appropriate and least restrictive
environment for a student. Connection! Final Decision and Order 00180, Conclusion 01‘
Law No.6 (November 30, 2000) (citing De Vries ta Fairfax County School Board, 882
F.2d 876 (Cir. 1989)). Where a student demonstrates stagnant or negative progress in the
nminsti‘enm, a private placement that provides appropriate suppons and services for the
student to make progress becomes the least restrictive enviromnent. WM. and KM. v.
Southern Regional Bd. of Educ” 46 IDELR 101 (D.N,J. 2006), see also, .1. D, v. N.1’.C.
Depl. q/Educl, 550 F.Supp.2d 420 (D.NY 2008), It is well settled that the least
restrictive environment for a child depends on his unique needs.

“H]t‘ placement in a public or private residential program is necessary to provide special
education and related services to a child with a disability, the program, including non-
medical care and room and board, must be at no cost to the parents of the child." 34 CPR
§300.104; 20 U.S.C.§1412 (a)(l); §1412 (a)(10)(B).

Parents seeking an alternative placement are not subject to the same mainstreaming
requirements as a school board. MS. Ex rel SS v. Board of E(luca/ion oflhe City of
Yonkers. 33 IDELR 183 (2“ Cir. 2000) citing Warren G. V. Cumberland CmmlySc/mnl

not held to the same standards as are school systems. Florence County Sch, Disl. V.
Curler, 510 11.8, 7, 114 $0. 361, 126 L.Ed. 2d 284 (1993). 11 is well settled that the
unilateral placement does not have to meet the standards ofa least restrictive environment
(LRE), nor does the unilateral placement have to include certiﬁed instructors in special
ucation 34 CFR §300.403(c), MS. ex rel S.. v Board ofEduca/lon qf/he Cily ononkers
33 IDELR 183 (2“6 Cir. 2000) citing Warren g. v1 Cumberland COIIMO'SC/IOOI DIs/ricl,
190 PM 80, 84 (3d Cir.1999) The test is whether the parents’ private placement is
appropriate, and not that it is peit‘ect. Here, because of the nature 01‘ CRBC, the Parents
are unable to unilaterally place the child and must rely upon the School or success in this
Due Process Hearing to accomplish this. The great weight ol‘the evidence establishes
that the Student has been provided FAPE at all relevant times, that he has made
meaningful progress, and that placement at CREC is not appropriate.

Compensatoty education is the “replacement of educational sewices the child should
have received in the ﬁrst place” and should “elevate [the Student] to the position he

during 2009-2010, ESY 2010, and the 2010-201 1 school years. Further, the Student has
made meaningﬁll progress. Accordingly, there is no basis upon which to award

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

1 .

The Board‘s IEP for the 2009-2010 school year provided the Student with FAPE.

The Board’s IEP for the ESY 2010 program provided the Student with FAPE.

The Board’s IEP for the 2010—11 school year provided the Student with FAPE.
