FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) as
deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20
U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et seq At a planning and
placement team (PPT) meeting, the Surrogate Parent rejected the program offered by the
Board for the 2012-2013 school year. The Surrogate Parent requested a clinical day
program for the Student. The Board refused the Sulrogate Parent’s request.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on June 27, 2012 and a pre—hearing
conference was attempted on July 9, 2012. The Surrogate Parent’s attorney was on trial
and had previous engagements which prevented a timely pre-hearing conference.

In an electronic transmission, the Surrogate Parent’s attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer
she would re-ﬁle the request for due process. Additional information was requested 0f the
Board in order to obtain more information about the Student but it was not provided.

I The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is September 9, 2012,

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is dismissed without prejudice,
