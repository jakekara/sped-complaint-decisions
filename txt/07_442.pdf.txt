SUMMARY: 

 
 The request for hearing, filed by the parent, was received on March 4, 2008, therefore, 
the deadline for mailing the Final Decision and Or
der is May 18, 2008.  On March 11, 2008 the 
Hearing Officer issued Notice of the Preheari
ng Conference scheduling the date of March 19, 
2008 and Ordered that both parties notify the Hearing Officer within five days via Fax what 

telephone number should be called for the Preheari
ng Conference.  The parent failed to respond 
to the Order and no telephone number was provided.  On March 17, 2008 the Hearing Officer 
issued an Order, again, directing the parent contact the Hearing Officer to provide a contact 
telephone number.  The parent failed to 
respond to the March 17, 2008 Order.   
On March 19, 2008, the Prehearing Conference commenced by initiating the telephone 
conference with Ms.Vaccaro who also had no current telephone number for the parent.  The 
Prehearing Conference was thereby continued to March 31, 2008.  On March 24, 2008, the 

Hearing Officer also issued Notice of Intention to Dismiss for failure to respond and that the 
Request for Hearing would be dismissed if the pa
rent failed to contact the Hearing Officer to 
provide such telephone number.  The parent has 
failed to contact the Hearing Officer and has 
failed to respond to the March 11, 17
, and 24, 2008 Notices and Orders.   
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
   The matter is 
DISMISSED.
