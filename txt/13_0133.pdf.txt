On September 14, 2012, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request for due process. On October
10, 2012 the hearing ofﬁcer ﬁled a Request for Recusal, which was agreed to by all parties. The current
hearing ofﬁcer was appointed to preside over the matter and on October 19, 2012 a preheating
conference was held with this hearing ofﬁcer. The parties agreed to mediate the matter rather than attend

a resolution session.

At the pre-hearing conference the parties agreed to cancel the hearing dates ot‘November 8 and
November 15, 2012, which had been previously chosen by the parties, and new hearing dates were
chosen. The new hearing dates were December 20 and 21, 2012‘ A brieﬁng schedule was agreed to by
the patties to address the issue of the hearing ofﬁcer’s jurisdiction to enforce and interpret a meditated
agreement, Before the scheduled ﬁling of the briefs, the Parent’s attorney requested withdrawal of the
jurisdictional issues and to only proceed with Issue No. 5 in this matter. The Parent’s attorney’s request
was denied (Hearing Ofﬁcer’s exhibit N0. 10).

In an electronic transmission dated December 1 1, 2012, the Parent‘s attorney advised the hearing
ofﬁcer that a family emergency required a request to cancel the hearing dates. The request was denied
and a request to withdraw the matter without prejudice was made. There was no objection from the
Board and the request was granted.

The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the parties’
mediation and the hearing dates, The date for mailing the F inal Decision and Order is December 28,
2012.
