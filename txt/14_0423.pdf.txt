Appearing before: Justino Rosado, Esq., Hearing Ofﬁcer

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1, Did the Board have a basis of knowledge that would have given the Student protection under
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), CFR §300.5 34, prior
to the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action? If yes;

2. Did the Board violate the Student’s procedural rights by the expulsion?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has not been identiﬁed as eligible to receive a free and appropriate public education (FAPE)
as deﬁned in the IDEA 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et seq.

The Student had a pending expulsion hearing and the Parent requested an expedited due process hearing.
The Parent assetts that the Board failed to act on the knowledge it had that the Student has a suspected
disability, and that his disciplinary history and teacher concerns should have resulted with the Board
evaluating the Student for special education eligibility. The Parent requests a stay of the expulsion
hearing. The Board refused the Parent’s request to stay the expulsion hearing.

On March 19, 2014, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request for an expedited due process. On
March 26, 2014, the parties held a resolution meeting. An impaltial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on
March 14, 2014 and a pre-hearing conference was held on March 19, 2014. Hearing dates of April 9
and 10, 2014 were chosen by the panies. In an electronic transmission dated April 7, 2014, Parent’s
attorney informed the hearing ofﬁcer that the matter had been resolved. The Parent’s attorney withdrew
the matter with prejudice. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is May 2, 2014‘

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
