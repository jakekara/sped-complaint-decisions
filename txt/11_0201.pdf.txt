FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Did the Board’s 2010-2011 Individualized Education Program (IEP) and special
education placement deny the Student a free appropriate public education in the least
restrictive environment?

2. If so, is placement at Eagle Hill Southport appropriate to the Student’s special
education needs in the least restrictive environment?

3. Is the Board responsible for reimbursing Parents their documented cost for the
unilateral placement at Eagle Hill Southport, and further funding of the placement
and transportation?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This hearing was requested by Parents on November 16, 2010, and the Hearing Ofﬁcer
was appointed on the same day. The date for mailing the decision was January 30, 2011.
A pre-hearing conference was held on December 1, 2010 At that time, the Parties
reported that they had agreed to waive the resolution meeting and request mediation from

February 23, 201 1 -2- Final Decision and Order 11-0201

the State Department of Education. Mediation was scheduled for December 16, 2010,
and J anuary 25, 2011. The Parties requested that the decision date be extended to
accommodate mediation; that request was granted by the Hearing Ofﬁcer, and the
decision date was extended to March 2, 2011.

The hearing was scheduled for January 25 and February 7, 201 1. The'January date was
postponed to accommodate mediation, and the February date was postponed to
accommodate further negotiations. The Parents withdrew their request for hearing on
February 18, 201 1, after an agreement had been executed.

A11 motions and objections not previously ruled upon, if any, are hereby overruled.

SUMMARY:

The Parents believed that the services provided for Student had not been adequate,
objecting to his placement in Scientiﬁc Research-Based Intervention (SRBI) in ﬁrst
grade. He had then been referred for a special education evaluation in February of that
school year and found to be eligible for special education as learning disabled. Parents
rejected the IEP offered by the Board and unilaterally enrolled the Student at Eagle Hill
Southport at the beginning of his second grade year.

In order to comply with the conﬁdentiality requirements of the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of1974, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g and related regulations at 34 C.F.R. §
99, the following decision uses “Student”, “School”, “Parent”. And titles of school staff
members and other witnesses in place of names and other personally identiﬁable

information.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The dispute having been settled and the request for hearing withdrawn, this matter is
DISMISSED.
