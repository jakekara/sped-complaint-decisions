Parents’ request. On June 21, 2016, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. An

the matter with prejudice. The mailing date of the Final decision and Order was extended to accommodate
the hearing date. The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order is October 7, 2016.
