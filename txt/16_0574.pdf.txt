FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
 
 
 
ISSUE
: 
 
 
 
Was the evaluation conducted by the District appropriate, thereby relieving the District of the 
obligation to provide an Independent Edu
cational Evaluation of Student at public expense?
 
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY
:    
 
 
On June 2, 2016, Parent received a request for a special due process hearing filed by the District. 
On June 6, 2016, the Connecticut State Department of Education appoi
nted this Hearing Officer 
to preside over the case. 
 
On June 22, 2016, a prehearing conference was initiated and ended 
shortly thereafter, as Parent did not join the conference.
 
 
Parent subsequently sent an email to the 
Hearing Officer indicating she was n
ot aware of the conference until after it occurred. 
 
A second 
prehearing conference was held on July 1, 2016.  During this prehearing conference, a hearing 
date of September 6, 2016 was set and the deadline for mailing the final decision and order was 
esta
blished as July 15, 2016. 
 
Also during the conference, the Parties indicated that they were 
going to participate in mediation and the District requested an extension of the deadline for the 
mailing of the final decision and order in order to allow the part
ies to participate in mediation. 
Parent agreed to this request, which was granted and resulted in a revised mailing deadline is 
August 12, 2016.
 
 
The parties subsequently settled the matter and on August 5, 2016, Parent 
withdrew the request for a special 
education hearing.
 
 
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
: 
 
 
In light of the above facts, the case is dismissed
.
