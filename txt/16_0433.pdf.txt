FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

Is the Student entitled to an independent reading evaluation at public expense?
PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Wethersﬁeld Board of Education requested a special education due process hearing
in the above—captioned matter on March 28, 2016. This Impartial Hearing Ofﬁcer was
appointed to hear the case on April 4, 2016. A telephonic pre—hearing conference was
convened on April 22, 2016. Attorney Peter Maher appeared on behalf of the
Wethersﬁeld Board of Education (“Board”). The Student’s parent appeared on behalf of
the Student.

The Board identiﬁed the question whether the Student’s right to invoke a request for an
independent educational evaluation was triggered in this case before the Board’s
evaluation was completed. In order to resolve this preliminary issue, it was determined
that the Board would submit a motion on or before May 6, 2016 and that the Student
would have until May 20, 2016 to submit a response. The Board submitted a Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings/Summary J udgment (“Motion”) on May 6, 2016. The Student
declined to submit a response to the Motion.

The ﬁndings of fact and conclusions of law set forth herein refer to documentary
evidence submitted with the Motion that was not disputed by the Student.

All motions and objections not previously ruled upon, if any, are hereby overruled. T0
the extent a procedural claim raised by the Student is not speciﬁcally addressed herein,
the Hearing Ofﬁcer has concluded that the claim lacked merit.

To the extent that the procedural history, summary, and ﬁndings of fact actually represent
conclusions of law, they should be so considered, and Vice versa. For reference, see

816 (MD. Tenn. 1985).

SUMMARY:

The Student requested an independent reading evaluation while the Board’s planned
triennial reevaluation of the Student was still undeiway. The Board ﬁled this due process
case in order to request a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate. The Board
then ﬁled the Motion to establish, based on undisputed facts, that it had no obligation to
ﬁle this due process case because the Student’s request was made before the Board’s
reevaluation was completed.

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes
(“C.G.S.”) §lO—76h and related regulations, 20 United States Code (“U.S.C.”) §l415(t)
and related regulations, and in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedure
Act (“U.A.P.A.”), C.G.S. §§4-l76e to 4-178, inclusive, §§4—181a and 4-186.

FINDINGS OF FACT:

1. The Student is eligible for special education and related services under the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq (“IDEA”)
and applicable state law.

2. On November 10, 2015, the Student’s Planning and Placement Team (“PPT”)
planned a triennial reevaluation of the Student. (Motion Exhibit B)

3. On J anuary 6, 2016, the PPT recommended that the evaluation also include an
assistive technology assessment by Board staff, and that an outside certiﬁed
Wilson reading teacher be retained to review the Student’s records, to observe the
delivery of Wilson instruction in school and to meet and confer with the Student’s
parent and school staff and discuss the parent’s concerns. (Motion Exhibit C)

4. On March 10, 2016, the Student’s parent requested an independent reading
evaluation at public expense. (Motion Exhibit D)

5. In response to the Student’s request for an independent reading evaluation at
public expense, the Board ﬁled this request for a special education due process
hearing.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DISCUSSION:

1. IDEA affords students identiﬁed as eligible for special education and related
sewices a panoply of procedural rights. Among these is the right to obtain an
independent educational evaluation of the student at public expense if the student

 

June 8, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0433

10.

disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the board of education. 20 U.S.C. §
l4lS(b)(l); 34 Code of Federal Regulations (“C.F.R.”) § 300.502

The purpose of an educational evaluation or revaluation is to determine whether
the student is eligible for special education and related services and to identify the
student’s educational needs. 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.301 and 300.303

A board of education must evaluate and periodically reevaluate the student in all
areas of suspected disability. 34 C.F.R. § 300.304

An independent educational evaluation is an evaluation conducted by a qualiﬁed
examiner who is not employed by the board of education that is responsible for
the student‘s education. 34 C.F.R. § 300.502 (a)(3)(i)

If a student requests an independent educational evaluation at public expense
because the student disagrees with the board of education’s evaluation or
reevaluation, the board of education must either ﬁle a due process complaint to
request a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate or ensure that an
independent educational evaluation is provided at public expense. 34 CPR. §
300.502 (b)

If a student requests an independent educational evaluation because the student
disagrees with the board of education’s evaluation, the board of education may
ask, but may not require, that the student provide a reason for his or her objection.
34 C.F.R. § 300.502(b)

A student is entitled to only one independent educational evaluation at public
expense each time the board of education conducts an evaluation with which the
student disagrees. 34 C.F.R. § 300.502(b)

A student’s right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense is
conditioned upon the student’s disagreement with an educational evaluation
obtained by a board of education. 34 C.F.R. § 300.502(b); KL. v. Plainville
Board ofEducafz'on, 363 F. Supp.2d 222 (D. Conn. 2005); Letter to Zirkel, 52
IDELR 77 (OSEP Dec. 11, 2008)

In turn, a board of education’s obligation to either ﬁle a due process complaint to
request a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate or ensure that an
independent educational evaluation is provided at public expense is also
conditioned upon the student’s disagreement with an educational evaluation
obtained by the board of education. 34 CPR. § 300.502(b); R.L. v. Plainville
Board ofEdL/carion, 363 F. Supp.2d 222 (D. Conn. 2005); Letter In Zirkel, 52
IDELR 77 (OSEP Dec. 11, 2008)

A student’s right to an independent educational evaluation and a board of
education’s obligation to either ﬁle a due process complaint to request a hearing

to show that its evaluation is appropriate or ensure that an independent
educational evaluation is provided at public expense do not arise until the board
of education’s educational evaluation is completed, so that the student can
disagree with it. 34 C.F.RV § 300.502(b); R.L. v. Plainville Board of Education,
363 F. Supp.2d 222 (D. Conn. 2005); Letter to Zirkel, 52 IDELR 77 (OSEP Dec.
11, 2008)

Accordingly, because the Student here did not disagree with a completed
educational evaluation obtained by the Board, the Student did not have a right to
an independent educational evaluation at public expense. 34 C.F.R. § 300.502(b);
R.L, v. Plainville Board of Education, 363 F. Supp.2d 222 (D. Conn. 2005); Letter
to Zirkel, 52 IDELR 77 (OSEP Dec. 11, 2008)

Moreover, because the Student did not disagree with a completed educational
evaluation obtained by the Board, the Board did not have an obligation to either
ﬁle a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that its evaluation is
appropriate or ensure that an independent educational evaluation was provided at
public expense. 34 C.F.R. § 30050203); RL. v. Plainville Board of Education,
363 F. Supp.2d 222 (D. Conn. 2005); Letter to Zirkel, 52 IDELR 77 (OSEP Dec.
11, 2008)

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The Student requested an independent educational evaluation but did not disagree with a
completed evaluation that was obtained by the Board. Accordingly, the Board did not
have an obligation to either ﬁle a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that
its evaluation is appropriate or ensure that an independent educational evaluation was
provided at public expense. As a result, this case is dismissed.

 

If the local or regional board of education 01' the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance With the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
