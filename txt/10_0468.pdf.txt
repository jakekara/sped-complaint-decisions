ISSUE Does the Hearing Officer have jurisdiction over this 
due process request where the issues raised have 
been settled by the parties in 
a signed mediation agreement? 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
The Parent (Mother) requested this hearing by faxing a request for an impartial due process hearing to the State Department of Education ("SDE") on June 7, 
2010.  The Board received a copy of the complaint on 
June 9, 2010. This Hearing Officer was assigned to 
the case on that date.  On June 18, 2010, the Board&#8482;s attorney filed an appearance. On June 21, 2010, a prehearing conference was held with the Parent and the 

Board&#8482;s attorney.  The Board&#8482;s attorney stated that th
e parties had entered into a mediation agreement on May 
6, 2010 in Case #10-0398, which resolved the Student&#8482;s program and placement for summer 2010 and the 2010
-
2011 school year. The Parent stated th
at she had received a contract from Ben Bronz Academy, which needed 
to be signed by the beginning of July. The Board was as
ked to file its Motion to Dismiss by June 25, 2010. 
The Parent stated that she could file a response by June 30, 2010.  The ruling on the motion would be made by 
July 2, 2010. A hearing date was agreed on for July 
16, 2010 in the event that the motion was denied.  The mailing date for the final decision was set at August 23, 2010. 
On June 25, 2010, the Board&#8482;s attorney filed the motion 
to dismiss along with a 
copy of the settlement 
agreement signed by the Parent and a Board administ
rator on May 6, 2010.  On June 30, the Mother filed a response in which she claimed, 
inter alia, that the Board had violated the agreement and that at the time of the 
mediation she did not have a contract for the Student 
to attend the Ben Bronz Academy.  She stated that two 
days following the mediation, she received this contract. 
She argued that the Board should pay for the private school placement.  On July 2, 2010, the Hearing Officer 
granted the motion to dismiss and advised the parties 
that a final decision and order would be mailed to them by the SDE.
