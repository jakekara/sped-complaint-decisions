PROCEDURAL HISTORY  

 The Parents' attorney requested this 
expedited hearing on April 3 by faxing a request for a due process hearing to the State Department of Education ("SDE") and a 
copy to the Board's Director of Pupil Servi
ces. The Board and the SDE received the letter 
and request on April 4.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on April 7.  The 
Board's attorney filed an appearance on April 11.  A prehearing conference was held on 

April 21, 2008.  Two hearing dates were agreed on for April 30 and May 8.  The mailing 
date for the final decision was set at May 22, 2008.  
On April 29, the Parents' 
attorney requested a postponement of the April 30 
hearing because the parties had reached a settlement agreement and needed time to draft 
and sign the agreement.  The request was granted and the Parents' attorney was given a 

deadline of May 2 to notify the Hearing Offi
cer if the hearing on May 8 was necessary.  
On May 1, the Parents' attorney advised 
the Hearing Officer that the May 8 hearing 
would not be necessary and that the parties expected to have the agreement signed by 

May 9.  On May 6, the Hearing Officer advised the parties that the May 8 hearing was 
cancelled and that the ca
se would be dismissed. 
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 
It is ordered that this 
case shall be dismissed.
