 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  
ISSUES: 1. Should the Parents&#8482; evaluator be permitted to perform an all day 

observation of the Student at the Board&#8482;s school? SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY: This matter was presented as a conteste
d matter pursuant to Connecticut General 
Statutes (CGS) &#167;10-76h and related regula
tions, 20 United States Code&#167;1415(f) and related regulations, and in accordance with 
the Uniform Administration Procedures Act, 
CGS &#167;&#167;4-176e to 4-178, inclusive, and 4-181a and 4-186. The Student is a young man who had been iden
tified as Other Health Impaired and a 
student entitled to receive a 
free and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. The Parents&#8482; rejected the determination of 
the PPT concerning the eligibility of the 
Student as a student requiring special education 
and related services.  The Parents had conducted an independent neuropsychological evaluation which the Board agreed to pay. The Parents, at a PPT to review the evaluati
on of the Student, requested that the evaluator 
be permitted to conduct an all day observation 
of the Student at the Board&#8482;s school.  The 
Board refused the Parents&#8482; request.  The Parents filed for Due Process requesting that the evaluator be permitted to conduct the observation.
