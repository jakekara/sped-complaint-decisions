and the hearing date was rescheduled to September 14, 2012.

concluded that the claim lacked merit.

To the extent that any pcltion of this Final Decision and Order states a Finding of Fact or a Conclusion
of Law, the statement should be so considered without regard to the given label of the section of this
Final Decision and Order in which that statement is found. See, e.g., SAS Institute, Inc, v. S & H
Computer Systems, Inc, 605 F. Supp. 816 (MD. Tenn, 1985); Bonnie Ann F v. Callahen Independent
School Board, 835 FSupp. 340 (SD. Tex. 1993).

SUMMARY:

The Parents unilaterally placed the Student out of district at Villa Maria School for the 2010-201 1 and
the 201 1—2012 school years and brought this Due Process proceeding under the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401, et seq. (the "IDEA") and Section 10-76h 0fthe
Connecticut General Statutes to seek reimbursement from the Board for that placement. Prior to
bringing this action, the Parents had engaged in voluntary mediation with the Board with the assistance
of a state appointed mediator pursuant to R.C.S.A. § 10-76h-5. The Parents had been represented by an
attorney in the mediation. The parties executed a Settlement Agreement in February of 2012. The
Board has ﬁled a Motion to Dismiss on jurisdictional grounds. The Parents oppose the Motion to
Dismiss. In their opposition papers and at oral argument, Parents argue that the Settlement Agreement is
unenforceable because they did not execute the Settlement “voluntarily.” The Parents argue that the
Hearing Ofﬁcer should conduct a hearing to hear testimony regarding their conversations with their
attorney and the discussions with the Board previous to the execution of the agreement. The Hearing
Ofﬁcer declined to take parole evidence but accepted the Parents’ offers of proof.

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes (C.G.S.) §10—76h
and related regulations, 20 United States Code §1415(t) and related regulations, and in accordance with
the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (U.A.P.A.), C.G.S. §§4~176e to 4—178, inclusive, §§4-181a
and 4-186.

FINDINGS OF FACT:

The parties presented oral argument and no testimonial evidence was offered or taken at the October 22
hearing. For the purpose of this Final Decision and Order, the Findings of Fact are based upon those
offers of proof taken in the light most favorable to the Parents who oppose the Board’s Motion to
Dismiss. The source of the Findings of Fact include (1) the patties’ stipulation of facts; (2) the Parents’
offer of proof at oral argument; (3) the papers submitted by the palties including the Student’s 201 1-
2012 Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) and other documents in educational record. In addition,
these ﬁndings include factual representations contained in the Parents’ opposition brief to the extent that
they are relevant to the issues and do not Violate R.C.S.A. § 10-76h-5(b) and 34 C.F4R. §300.506(b)(8).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DISCUSSION:

1. This administrative hearing was commenced pursuant to the IDEA and applicable Connecticut
special education law. Pursuant to the IDEA, a local educational agency ("LEA") is responsible for
providing disabled children within its jurisdiction with a free and appropriate public education
program (“FAPE “) in the least restrictive environment (“LRE”). See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1412(a)(1);
1412(a)(5)(A). When there is a disagreement between the parents of such a child and the LEA over
whether the LEA has satisﬁed its obligations under the IDEA, the parents may commence a special
education due process hearing and thereaﬁer seek review of the hearing ofﬁcer's decision by a coutt
if they are aggrieved by that decision.

2. Under the IDEA, where the parents of a child challenge a special education program proposed by an
LEA, the issue to be resolved is whether the LEA's proposed program provides the child with a
FAPE as determined by applying the two prong test stated in Board ofEducation ofHendrick
Hudson School District v. Rowley, 458 US. 176. 206—07 (1982).

3. Under Rowley, the Board's proposed programs for the 2010-201 1 and 201 1—2012 school years would
provide the Student with a FAPE if the proposed Individualized Education Plan ("IEP"): (1) was
developed in compliance with the IDEA's procedural requirements; and (2) was "reasonably
calculated to enable [the Student] to receive educational beneﬁts," 01', in other words, "likely" to
produce more than trivial 01‘ de minimis progress. 1d. The IDEA does not require that the Board
provide the best program money can buy or provide a program that has all of the features that the
Parents desire.

4. The Board argues that this Hearing Ofﬁcer lacks jurisdiction to consider the issues of FAPE and
unilateral placement because of the parties’ duly executed settlement agreement. The Parents argue
that the Settlement Agreement should not be enforced.

5. §10-76h 0f the Connecticut General Statutes confines the jurisdiction of Hearing Officers to
conﬁrming, modifying or rejecting the identiﬁcation, evaluation or educational placement 0f or the
provision of FAPE to a child, to determining the appropriateness of a unilateral placement of a child
or to prescribing alternative special education programs for a child.

6. The parties agree that they entered into a Settlement Agreement and that it settles the issues raised
by the Parents’ Revised Due Process Complaint. The Hearing Ofﬁcer has reviewed the Settlement
Agreement and agrees with the parties that all the issues raised in the July 16, 2012 Revised Due

November 15, 2012 Final Decision and Order 12—0512

Process Complaint are settled in the Settlement Agreement.

When the patties have entered into an agreement, the Hearing Ofﬁcer has no jurisdiction to decide
its validity. Federal regulations provide that the forum to determine the validity of settlement
agreements should be determined by state or federal couns. See 34 CFR. 3 00,5 06(b)( 7).

34 CPR. 300.506(b)(7), which was promulgated in 2006, states that “[a] written, signed mediation
agreement under this paragraph is enforceable in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a
district court of the United States.” The regulation confers no jurisdiction on the Hearing Ofﬁcer to
determine the validity or enforceability of the Settlement Agreement.

The Parents’ argument that the Settlement Agreement is unenforceable is essentially based upon the
law of contract. Fuither, the Parents’ complaints are essentially with their attorney and not with the
Board. Those claims can be adjudicated either against the Board 01' their attorney in court. In any
event, the Parents’ arguments do not involve FAPE 01‘ any IDEA—related claims.

Although both Board and Parents have relied upon the Connecticut Federal District Coult’s holding
in Mr. J. et a] v. Board QfEducation, 98 F.SuppZd 226, 237 (D. Conn. 2000), in making their
arguments, the Hearing Ofﬁcer does not feel bound by that decision. Mr. J was decided prior to the
enactment of 34 CPR. 300.506(b)(7). The existence of 34 CPR, §300.506(b)(7) clearly obviates
any need for the Hearing Ofﬁcer to consider the enforceability of the Settlement Agreement.

Further, since the issues of enforceability are not before the Hearing Ofﬁcer, there is no need to hold
a hearing on the Parents’ evidence regarding enforceability of the Settlement Agreement.

The Hearing Ofﬁcer concludes that she lacks jurisdiction to review the matters in the Parents’ J uly
16, 2012 Revised Due Process Complaint and accordingly will grant the Board’s Motion to Dismiss.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The Board’s MOTION TO DISMISS is hereby GRANTED and the matter is DISMISSED WITH
PREJUDICE.
