FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Was the program offered by the Board for the 2012—2013 school year appropriate and does it provide the
Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE)?
If not;

2. Does the Student require a 1:1 physical therapist or a professional who is trained in his unique physical
and medical needs in order for him to receive FAPE in the LRB?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Multiple Disabilities and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the
Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut

General Statute §10-76a et seq.

At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the
2012-2013 school year. The Parents requested a 1:1 physical therapist or a professional who is trained in his
unique physical and medical needs. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On May 28, 2013, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The parties agreed to go to
mediation in place of a resolution meeting. An impaltial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on May 29, 2013 and a
pre-hearing conference was held on June 5, 2013. Hearing dates of July 21, 21, August 6 and 7, 2013 were

chosen by the patties.

In an electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties had an interim
summer plan they wanted to test to see if the matter could be resolved. The Parents’ attorney requested that the
matter be withdrawn without prejudice. There was no objection by the Board. The withdrawal was granted.
The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is August 1 1, 2013,
