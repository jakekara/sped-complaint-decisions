Avon, CT  06001  Appearing before:     Attorney Mary
 Elizabeth Oppenheim, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 
ISSUES:  1. Whether the Board&#8482;s program fo
r the Student is appropriate.  2. If not, whether the Student shall be placed in 
a school specific to children with Aspergers 
Disorder as requested by the Parent.   SUMMARY:  The Board received this request for hear
ing on February 9, 2009, and a prehearing 
conference was scheduled for March 5, 2009 at the request of the parties.  Prior to the prehearing conference, the Parent submitted a notice that she 
did not want to proceed with her request for 
due process, but requested that the state continue to oversee her request for the copies of the Student&#8482;s educational records.  Because th
e Parent did not submit an unequivocal notice regarding her pending case, the prehearing conference convened on March 5, 2009.  At that conference the Parent confirmed that she had just
 received the educational records and did not want to proceed with her hearing request at this time.   
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
   The matter is 
DISMISSED, without prejudice.
