d on December 27, 2006 and the parties both 
participated.  The Parent expressed the concern that her son had not been properly educated for years in the Board&#8482;s programs
 and now resists making an effort on school work because the Parent believes he has lear
ned he will be passed from grade to grade 
whether he makes an effort or not. The Boar
d expressed concern about the sufficiency of 
the request and subsequently filed a Sufficiency Challenge.  Prior to ruling on this Challenge and prior to hearing, the Parent indicated she prefe
rred to withdraw her request for due process without prejudice and participate in mediatio
n to attempt to resolve the 
issues.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
  The hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
