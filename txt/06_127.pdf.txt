 STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION    Student v. South Windsor Board of Education  
 Appearing on behalf of the Student:  Surrogate Parent, Pro Se 
 Appearing on behalf of the Board:  Ms. Denise E. Epps 
      Director of Special Services 
      South Windsor Public Schools 
      1737 Main Street 
      South Windsor, CT  06074 
   Appearing before:     Attorney Christine B. Spak 
Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  This hearing was requested by the surrogate parent for the purpose of trying to keep the student in the South Windsor school district for the few remaining weeks of the 2005-

2006 school year.  The surrogate parent did not name the receiving district, New Britain, 
as a party.  At the prehearing it became clear that this is essentially a residency issue and 
the parties were in agreement that the student did not reside in South Windsor at the time 
of the filing (or since) but rather in New Britain.  Prior to the date selected by the parties 
for hearing, the surrogate parent notified the hearing officer that the hearing was no 
longer necessary.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The hearing is dismissed.
