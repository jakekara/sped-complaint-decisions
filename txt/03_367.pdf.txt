  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   The matter was assigned on November 14, 2003, and a prehearing conference was 

held on November 19.  The hearing was scheduled to convene on December 18. 
  The Parent&#8482;s attorney submitted a request for postponement of the December 18 

hearing date to permit the parties to engage in good faith settlement negotiations, and to 
permit the Parent&#8482;s attorney additional time to prepare for the hearing.  On December 10, 
the Parent attorney&#8482;s request for a postponement of the December 18 hearing was 

granted, and the mailing date of the final decision was extended 30 days in accordance 
with Conn. Agencies Regs. Sec. 10-76h-9(e) so that the parties could attempt to settle 
this matter through mediation.   
  The Parent&#8482;s attorney submitted a second request for a postponement/extension 

on December 31, requesting that the January 12 hearing date be postponed so that the 
parties could attempt to settle this matter through mediation, as the scheduled mediation 
was postponed.  This second request was denied, as the parties are entitled to only one 
30-day postponement for settlement discussions, pursuant to Conn. Agencies Regs. Sec.
