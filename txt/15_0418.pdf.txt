1. Did the Norwalk Board of Education (“Board”) fail to provide the Student with a
free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”) for the extended school year
(“ESY”) summer session of 2014, and the 2014—2015 academic years by failing to
provide the Student with an individualized education program (“IEP”) tailored to the
Student’s speciﬁc needs?

2. Are the Parents entitled to reimbursement for their unilateral placement of the
Student at the Speech Academy for the 2014-2015 academic years, inclusive of the
2014 summer ESY period?

3. Is the Speech Academy an appropriate placement for the Student?

4. 1f the answer to issues 2 and 3 is “YES”; are the Parents entitled to transportation
costs for the unilateral placement of the Student at the Speech Academy?

5. Has the Board committed a procedural Violation by not having a valid IEP for the

Student over the course of the last four years? If the answer is “YES”, does this rise
to the level of a denial of FAPE for the Student?
