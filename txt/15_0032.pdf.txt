retaining counsel. A prehearing conference took place with Counsel on August 6, 2014, during
which the deadline for mailing the Final Decision and Order was established as August 29, 2014.
An extension of the deadline was requested on August 18, 2014 by the Board and after a
consideration of all the factors this request was granted. The revised deadline for mailing the
