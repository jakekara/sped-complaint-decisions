                            Howard Klebanoff, P.C.

 Appearing Before:    Attorney Gail K. Mangs, Hearing Officer 
                                         FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   This hearing was requested on September 17, 2003.  A prehearing conference was 
convened on September 23, 2003 at which time the parties requested, and was granted, a 
continuance in order to proceed to an advisory opinion.  A hearing date was set for November 13, 2003.  On November 11, 2003, the parents faxed a letter to the hearing 

officer requesting another postponement in or
der to obtain an independent evaluation and continue discussion of a possible resolution of the case.  While the hearing officer was 

unable to review this request until the late afternoon of November 12, 2003, the request 

was also not sent in a timely fashion, that is, five days before the hearing date as required.  
The hearing officer went to the school district on November 13, 2003 as scheduled; the 
school district attorney was present but the parents and their attorney were not in attendance.  The hearing was not convened but the record was briefly opened to describe the circumstances.  Due to the untimely request for continuance, the length of time that 
has elapsed since the initial hearing request and the uncertain amount of time needed to 

complete the independent evaluation, the hearing will be dismissed without prejudice. 
  Final Decision and Order:  This hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
