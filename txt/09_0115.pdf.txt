 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  
 ISSUES:  1. Was the Student eligible for special edu
cation either as Other Health Impaired 
(OHI) or as Seriously Emotionally Di
sturbed (SED) when the Planning and Placement Team (PPT) met in April, 2007? 
 2. If so, did the Board PPT offer an Individualized Education Program (IEP) and 
placement appropriate to the Student&#8482;s needs? 
 3. If the Board&#8482;s placement for 2008-2009 wa
s not appropriate to the Student&#8482;s needs, was the Parent&#8482;s unilateral placement of the Student at Rock Point School 
appropriate to his needs?  4. Is the Board responsible for funding 
the Student&#8482;s 2008-2009 placement at Rock 
Point School? 
 5. Did the PPT consider the Parent&#8482;s concerns regarding a free appropriate public education (FAPE) for the Student, or
 did the PPT deny the Student FAPE?
