February 2, 2011 2 Final Decision and Order 11-0157

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on October 18, 2010 and a pre-hearing
conference was held on October 28, 2010. Hearing dates of December 9 and 10, 2010

were chosen by the parties.

The Parent’s attorney notiﬁed the hearing ofﬁcer that the matter had been resolved but
the parties needed additional time to draft the agreement. On or about January 28, 201 1,
the Parent’s attorney notiﬁed the hearing ofﬁcer that the agreement had been signed and
the matter was settled. The Parent’s attorney requested that the matter be withdrawn with
prejudice.

In order to accommodate the mailing of a ﬁnal order and decision after the hearing date
and to accommodate the additional time to draft the agreement, the date for the ﬁling of
the Final Decision and Order was extended. The date for the Final Decision and Order is

February 23, 201 1.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
