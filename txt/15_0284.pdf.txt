FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and
Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents
rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2014-2015 school year. The Parents requested that the Student
be placed at Franklin Academy; the Board refused the Parents’ request. On February 6, 2015, the Board
received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on February
6, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was he1d on February 17, 2015. The parties agreed to waive a resolution
session and go to mediation on F ebruary 25, 2015. A hearing date of April 23, 2015 was chosen by the parties.
The Parents’ attorney requested an extension of the mailing date of the Final Decision and Order to
accommodate the hearing date; the mailing date was extended to May 21, 2015. In an electronic transmission,
the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the panties had resolved the matter and requested that the
matter be withdrawn with prej udice; the withdrawal was granted.

providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
