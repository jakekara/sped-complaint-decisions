Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  1. Whether the Student&#8482;s current program is appropriate. 
2. If not, whether the Student requires a one
-to-one aide, and any additional services/ supports to receive an appropriate education.  SUMMARY:  The Board received this request for hearing filed by the Surrogate Parent on January 27, 2006. [Exhibit H.O.-1]  The hearing was scheduled to convene on March 1.  A scheduling notice was issued on February 2, which ordered that the Surrogate Parent 
shall submit confirmation in writing that the Student, who is over the age of majority, has 

full knowledge and agreement that the Surrogate Parent was acting on her behalf in the 

matter.  [Exhibit H.O.-3]     No such confirmation was filed by the Surrogate Parent, 

although exhibits subsequently submitted by the Board included a consent to the 

continuation of services from a surrogate 
parent dated February 16, 2006. [Exhibit B-21]  
That consent, however, does not indicate that the Student had knowledge and agreement 

that the Surrogate Parent was acting on her behalf by filing this request for hearing, nor 
was it appropriately submitted by the Surrogate Parent to the hearing officer.
