 PROCEDURAL HISTORY  The parent requested a Due Process hearing on February 18, 2004.   A prehearing conference convened on February 20, 2004.  The moving party agreed to extend the date 
for final decision in the matter to permit time to schedule hearing dates.  On the first day 
of hearing the parties met in an attempt to reach a settlement.  After working they 
believed they had an agreement in principle and requested leave to address outstanding 
issues.  Both parties agreed to notify the hearing officer if additional hearing dates were 
necessary.  Neither party has requested additional hearing dates.    FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The case is dismissed without prejudice.
