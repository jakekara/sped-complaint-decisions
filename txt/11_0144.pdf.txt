PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This hearing was requested by Parent on 9/28/2010, although the Board did not receive a copy of
the request until 10/4/2010. The Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on 10/7/2010. The original date
for mailing the decision was 12/12/2010. A pt'e-hear'mg conference by conference telephone call
was held on 10/19/2010. At that time, the Parties reported that a resolution meeting was
scheduled for later that day. The hearing was scheduled for 12/7 and 12/14/2010, and the Parties
requested that the mailing date be extended to accommodate those dates. The Hearing Ofﬁcer

extended the mailing (late to 1/11/2011.

Following, a Planning and Placement Team (PPT) meeting on November 9, 2010, the Board ﬁled
a Motion to Dismiss 0n l 1/17/2010, claiming that all Parent’s issues had been addressed in a
revised Individualized Education Program (IEP). The Parent opposed the Motion to Dismiss by
email dated 1 1/19/2010. The Hearing Ofﬁcer denied the Motion to Dismiss on 1 1/20/2010.

The Board sent their exhibits and witness list to the Parent and lo the Hearing Ofﬁcer on

1 1/29/2010, in conformance with the “ﬁve (lay mle” (34 C.F.R. §300.512 (a) (3) and Section 10—
7611—12, Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (R.C.S.A.)). Subsequent additions to the
Board’s exhibits were submitted on 3/17, 3/18, 3/21, 3/22 and 4/6, 201 1. Parent initially tried to
send her exhibits to the Board’s Attorney by FAX, but there were too many documents for this to
be a practical delivery method. After various communications, Parent’s exhibits were offered at
the initial hearing session on 1/26/201 1, The Board objected and the Hearing Ofﬁcer
acknowledged the unreasonable delay but accepted the exhibits. It later developed that many of
the Parent’s exhibits duplicated Board exhibits or items in the Hearing Ofﬁcer’s administrative

record (see Appendix A).

The Parties requested mediation, which was scheduled for 12/7/2010. At that mediation session,
it was agreed to re-convene on 12/ 14/201 0. The Hearing Ofﬁcer postponed the hearing to
accommodate mediation. The December mediation session was postponed due to the Student’s
illness. The Patties requested that the mailing date be extended to accommodate settlement
negotiations, and the Hearing Ofﬁcer granted that request, extended the mailing (late from 1/1 1
to 2/10/201 1, on 12/14/2010. The second mediation session was scheduled for 1/11/201 1.

()n 12/21/2010, the Hearing Ofﬁcer te—sehetluled the hearing for 1/26, 2/15 and 2/22/2011,an<1
extended the mailing (late from 2/ 10/ t l to 3/12/20] I. On 1/13/201 1, Patent informed the
Hearing Ofﬁcer that mediation had not resolved the dispute.

On 1/26/201 1, prior to convening the hearing, the Hearing Ofﬁcer tried to clarify the status 01‘
Parent’s exhibits. When the hearing formally convened 0n the record, the Board renewed their
Motion for Dismissal and responded to each of the Parent’s m‘ne issues as either resolved or in
the process of resolution. Parent objected to dismissal, stating, that her questions had not all been
answered and not all the evaluations had been completed and discussed by the PPT. Meanwhile,
a snow storm had started and the school district had ordered an early dismissal. The Hearing
Ofﬁcer scheduled another hearing date for 3/22/201 1, providing time for completion of the
evaluations and another PPT meeting. She also extended the mailing date to 4/21/ 201 1. The
hearing was then adjourned early because of the snow storm.

tutorng is necessary because of the frequency and unpredictability of her episodes. It
would be unsafe for her to be at school without medical supervision. (Ex. B-70)

A Board Special Education Supewisor responded to the request for homebountl instruction
by letter dated 9/2/2010. Finding the physician’s letter of 8/17/2010 inadequate, the

vitamins. Nurse‘s summary:

[Student] continues to remain on homcbound status. There is documented concern of
“poiyphm'macy”use by some of the consulting physicians. This could contribute to the
confusing array of clinical symptoms that [Student] exhibits, challenging a deﬁnitive
diagnosis of “presumed mitochondrial disease”.

that she has referred [Student] to several doctors at YNHH for consultations in neurology
and genetics. [Student’s Pediatrician] will share the evaluations with [Schoo1 Medical

Adviser] as they become available.

78. Parent requested that instmction in Spanish be included in the Student’s homebound
program. This request was rejected by the Board on the grounds that Spanish is a “regular
education course”. (Testimony, Parent)

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:

1. Section 10~76h, Connecticut General Statutes (C.G.S.), and related regulations at Section 10—
76h, Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, authorize an impartial hearing ofﬁcer to
conduct a special education hearing and to render a i'mal decision in accordance with
Sections 4-176e through 4-180a, inclusive, and Sections 4-l8la 0fthe C.G.S. Section 20
U.S.C. § 1415(0 and related regulations at 34 C.F.R. § 300.51] through § 300.520 a|so
authorize special education hearings.

2. Pursuant to Section 10-76d-15 (b), R.C.S.A., the PPT has authority to provide homebound
instruction when it ﬁnds one or more of the following:

o A physician has certiﬁed in writing that the child is unable to attend school for
medical reasons and has stated the expected date the child will be able to return to the
school.

- The child has a handicap so severe that it prevents the child from learning in a school
setting, or the child’s presence in school endangers the health, safety or welfare of the
child or others.

0 A special education program recommendation is pending and the ehitcl was at home
at the time ot'referral.

3. Section tO—76d-l 5 (d), R.C.S.A., provides that at least two hours per day or ten hours per
week of instruction be provided for homebound students in grades seven through twelve.
While it is agreed that the Student can currently manage two hours of instmetion on a good
day with homework on her own, if her condition improves she would beneﬁt from an
increased amount of tutoring in preparation for a return to school.

4. The Hearing Ofﬁcer takes administrative notice of the Assessment Guidelines for

Admilﬂstering the Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT), Connecticut Academic Performance
Test (CAPT) and Connecticut Alternate Assessments for 2010-201 1 and the Connecticut

15

 

April 20, 201 1 Final Decision and Order 1 1-0144

State Department of Education’s 10/30/2009 communication to school districts, “Connecticut
Mastery Test and Connecticut Academic Performance Modiﬁed Assessment System”.

5. Section 34 C.F.R. 300.10 lists core academic subjects: English, reading or language atts,
mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, histoty and
geography. It appears that the Board has no legal basis for refusing to provide Spanish
instruction within it homebound program

DISCUSSION

While the issue of homebound instruction was resolved by the PPT on 1 1/9/2010, it has been
mentioned that the six—month plan for homebound services expires in 5/201 1 and that further
medical documentation wilt be required at that time. The State regulations concerning
homebound instmction speciﬁcally require that a physician provide a written statement that the
child is unable to attend school for medical reasons and provide an expected (late for the child‘s
return to school. Many, it‘ not all, of the Physician‘s letters offered by Parent met this standard.
A Physician’s statement that return to school is hoped for, but cannot be predicted, sufﬁciently
addresses the regulatory requirement»

Many school districts interpret this regulation to require a specific medical diagnosis, and indeed
that may be a local district policy. However, no such policy was entered on the record ofthis

hearing.

In Student‘s ease, as various symptoms developed, Parent sought medical advice from a variety
of specialists. Parent refused to grant the Board broad access to Student’s medical records and
provided her own reports, summarizing symptoms, possible dmg interactions and other
inlbrmation gleaned from these specialists. Board staft‘appear to have been suspicious, despite
Parent‘s nursing background and her contacts with reputable specialists. The wording of the
regulation cited above is clear, and requests for homebound instmction do require a physician’s

written statement.

Section 10-76d—15 (b) (1), R.C.S.A,, does not require the release ofmedicnl records to the
school: all that is required is a written statement from a physician. The excellent summaty
provided by the School Nurse after receiving Parent‘s consent for consultation with Student’s
Pediatrician is dated 3/1 7/201 1: it is unfortunate that a simihtt' report was not available to the
PPT earlier. Both Parties would also have beneﬁted from t] clear statement 1' rom the Board,
when rejecting a physician’s request for homebound instruction, of what was required by the
Board to secure such services.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

1, Since homebound instmction was approved by the PPT 0n 1 1/9/2010, the issue of Student’s
stay put placement is moot and therefore DISMISSED.

2. Since homebountl instruction was provided at the 1 1/9/2010 PPT meeting, this issue is moot
and therefore DISMISSED.

16

April 20, 201 | Final Decision and Order I l~0144

3. While there has been a problem of Student’s fatigue limiting the amount of homebound
instruction, such instruction should have included Spanish as requested by Parent. In order to
make up lost time in Spanish, the Board shall devise an extended year program for 201 1, to
provide Spanish instruction to the Student sufﬁcient to meet credit requirements.

4. The PPT shall consult with Student’s Pediatrician concerning her availability for additional
homebound instruction, Such consultation may be in person at a PPT meeting or through the

School Nurse.

5. Since almost all 01‘ the equipment recommended by the AT evaluators has been provided (or is
on 01'der)this issue is moot and is DISMISSED,

6, Student has received AT, OT and PT evaluations and consultations. This issue is moot and is
DISMISSED,

7. Student has received counseling. However, she remains isolated from her peers. The PPT
shall explore the possibilities of an electronic connection via her schooI-provided computer that
would enable her to observe and palticipate in one class on a regular basis.

8. The adaptations, modiﬁcations and accommodations documented in the Student‘s current IEP
are sufﬁcient.

9. Testing accommodations have been provided in Student’s lEl’, including the oppomtnity to
take Districtwide tests aan from other students and to extend the time for completing the tests.
She has also been allowed to use her computer, and when necessary to have test questions read to
her, These accommodations shall be considered at each PPT meeting, and up—dated as

necessary"
