30, 2016 Planning and Placement Team meeting appropriate?

2. If the District’s IEP was not appropriate, is the residential program provided by the
Waterford Country Day School appropriate, and are Parents entitled to reimbursement of
tuition and costs associated with Parent’s placement at this school?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On April 8, 2016, the Board received a request for a special education due process hearing ﬁled
by Attorney for the Parents. The undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed by the Connecticut
State Depaltment of Education on that same day. During the prehearing conference held on April
12, 2016, hearing dates of May 27, 2016, June 13, 2016 and June 22, 2016 were set and the
deadline for mailing the ﬁnal decision and order was estabhshed as June 22, 2016. On April 20,
2016, the Attorney for the Board sent an email representing that both parties were jointly
requesting a postponement of the May 27, 2016 date in order to allow the parties to engage in
mediation. The Hearing Ofﬁcer requested written conﬁrmation that a mediation session was in
fact scheduled. Upon receipt of an email on April 27, 2016 containing documentation that a
mediation was scheduled for May 26, 2016, the request for postponement of the May 27, 2016
hearing date was granted. On June 7, 2016, Attorney for the Parents withdrew Student’s hearing
request without prejudice.
