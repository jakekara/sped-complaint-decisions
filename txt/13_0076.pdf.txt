SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in The Individuals
with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General
Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parent rej ected the
program offered by the Board for the 2012-2013 school year. The Parent requested placement at Winston
Preparatory School for the 2012-2013 school year. The Board refused the Parent’s request.

On August 16, 2012, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request for due process. The parties agreed
to go to mediation in place of a resolution meeting. An impaltial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on August
17, 2012 and a pre—hearing conference was held on August 27, 2012. Hearing dates of November 14, 29
and December 6 and 7, 2012 were chosen by the patties.

In an electronic transmission, the Parent’s attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the paities were able to
resolve the matter but needed additional time to ﬁnalize the agreement. On November 30, 2012 the

Parent’s attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the agreement had been ﬁnalized and requested that the
matter be withdrawn with prejudice. The withdrawal with prejudice was granted.

The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the parties’
mediation and the hearing dates. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is December 4, 2012.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
