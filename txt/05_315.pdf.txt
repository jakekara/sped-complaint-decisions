 1 During the prehearing conference on October 31, 2005, Atto
rney Gregory P. Carnese, on behalf of the Parent, 
tailored the original issues as written in the Request for Impartial Special Education Hearing (H.O. Exh. 1) to the 
issues specifically stated above.  Such issues, as written in this Decision, were the issues prescribed for mediation 
between the parties on November 28, 2005, and again were e
xpressly outlined by the Hearing Officer for the Parent during the first day of hearing on December 7, 2005, without objection.  
   Subsequent to mediation, the Parent terminated the representation of Attorney Carnese.  
   By e-mail addressed solely to the Hearing Officer, 
dated December 30, 2005, the Pa
rent provided a written claim 
for administrative error regarding the issues as fully ad
judicated, citing the original written Request for Impartial 
Special Education Hearing as the basis for her filing of 
due process.  After forwardi
ng such claim to Attorney 
Moses, and in consideration of both parties&#8482; position relative 
to the Parent&#8482;s claim,  th
e Hearing Officer ruled that the Parent was provided adequate notice of the issues for ad
judication, to which she failed to express any objection.  
Thus, no administrative error was found and the issues were adequately presented during the prehearing conference, 

mediation, and at the commencement of the hearing.
