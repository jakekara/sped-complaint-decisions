PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On March 29, 2016, the Board received a request for a Special Education Due Process Hearing
ﬁled by the Parents. On March 31, 2016, the Connecticut State Department of Education
appointed this Hearing Ofﬁcer to preside over the matter. During the preheating conference held
on April 8, 2016, hearing dates of June 6, 2016 and June 10, 2016 were set and the deadline for
mailing the ﬁnal decision and order was established as Friday, June 10, 2016. The parties
indicated at the conference that there would be no mediation. The need for a request for an

extension of the mailing deadline to accommodate the agreed upon hearing date schedule was
discussed during the preheating conference. Parents submitted a request for an extension of the
mailing deadline by email on May 9, 2016. This request was granted on the record at the outset
of the ﬁrst hearing date on June 6, 2016 and resulted in a new mailing deadline of July 7, 2016.
Subsequent discussion at the hearing brought to ﬁght the desire of the Parents to amend their
hearing request to address the IEP proposed by the District on June 1, 2016 at a PPT meeting.
The IEP from this meeting had not yet been generated by the District and thus, in order to
provide the opportunity for the Parents to receive the IEP, review it and respond with an
amended hearing request, the parties agreed to suspend the hearing on June 6, 2016, postpone the
June 10, 2016 hearing date and add July 29, 2016, August 10, 2016, August 22, 2016 and August
23, 2016 to the hearing date schedule. As the revised July 7, 2016 mailing deadline fell after the
July 29, 2016 hearing date, Parents requested an extension of the mailing date on the record in
order to accommodate the agreed upon hearing date schedule. This request was granted and
resulted in a new mailing deadline of August 5, 2016. On June 19, 2016, Parents ﬁ1ed an
amended complaint and a second preheating conference was held on J une 24, 2016 to discuss the
issues presented in the amended complaint. Parents provided the Board with further articulation
of the procedural and substantive concerns regarding the June 1, 2016 IEP in a document sent on
June 30, 2016. The Board consented to the amendment. Pursuant to 34 CFR §500.508(d)(4), the
timelines for the resolution conference and resolution period under 34 CFR §300.510(a) and 34
CFR §300i510(b) restarted 011June 19, 2016, the date the amended complaint was ﬁled. This
resulted in a revised deadline of September 2, 2016 for the mai1ing of the ﬁnal decision and
order. Juiy 26, 2016, Attorney for the Parents ﬁ1ed his appearance and notiﬁed the Hearing
Ofﬁcer in writing that the matter had settled and Parents were withdrawng their hearing request
with prejudice.
