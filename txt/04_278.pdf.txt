          Hearing Officer 
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   This matter had been filed by previous counsel for the student on August 3, 2004 and 

refiled by previous counsel on August 17, 2004.  The previous case number was 04-262.  
The prehearing conference in the instant matter was scheduled for August 23, 2004 with 
the date for mailing of the final decision set at September 30, 2004.  On August 23, 2004 
the parent faxed the hearing officer a letter informing her and the board counsel that she 
was in the process of obtaining new counsel, but referencing the prior case number (04-

262) and requesting a continuance in the case.  On August 26, 2004 the hearing officer responded referencing the correct case number 
(04-278), granting the continuance, setting a hearing date and explaining the need to schedule the hearing within forty-five days 
unless an appropriate request for further extension was received.  The parent responded that her prior attorney had not told her of the change of case number and she did not have 

the address for the hearing.  On September 8, 2004 the board&#8482;s counsel wrote a letter 
requesting that the hearing officer order an evaluation.  Prior to the date of hearing and prior to the ruling on the request in the letter, the parent retained new counsel (above) 
who withdrew the request for hearing.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The matter is 
DISMISSED.
