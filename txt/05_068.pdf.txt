April 5, 2005 - 1 - Final Decision and Order 05-068   STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION    Southington Board of Education v. Student      Appearing for the Board: Nicole A. Bernabo, Esq. Sullivan, Schoen, Campane & Connon, LLC 646 Prospect Avenue Hartford, CT  06105-4286  Appearing for the Student: The Mother and Father, appearing separately and pro se  Appearing Before:  Scott Myers, J.D., M.A. (Clinical Psychology)     Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  This matter was commenced by the Southington Board of Education (the &#64257;Board&#64258;), which raises three issues for hearing (the &#64257;Board&#8482;s Issues&#64258;).   The Board commenced this proceeding when the Mother disagreed with certain decisions made at a PPT convened on February 28, 2005.  The Student&#8482;s birthparents are divorced and at the current time jointly share custody of the Student.  Both Parents have been identified as parties to this case, although the Father does not challenge the determinations made by the PPT.  The telephonic Pre-Hearing Conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) in this matter convened on March 25, 2005.   The Board&#8482;s Counsel (Ms. Bernabo) and the Mother (appearing pro se) participated.  The Father could not participate in the PHC, but agreed that the PHC may proceed in his absence given that his interests are aligned with the Board&#8482;s interests with respect to the Board&#8482;s issues.  Based on the discussion at the PHC, and various letters submitted by the Mother before and after the PHC, it was unclear whether any live issues remained for hearing.  The pre-hearing procedural schedule established at the PHC was intended to maximize the opportunities for the Board and the Mother to resolve any disagreement that remained live between them.  By letter dated April 1, 2005, the Board reported that it was withdrawing its request for hearing without prejudice to refiling.     For these reasons, the April 27, 2005 hearing date is cancelled and this matter is dismissed without prejudice to refiling.
