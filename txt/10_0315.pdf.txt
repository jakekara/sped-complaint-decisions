ISSUE: 1. Was the Board&#8482;s neuropsychological evaluation of the Student valid and appropriate? PROCEDURAL HISTORY: 
The Board&#8482;s attorney faxed a letter to the 
State Department of Education (&#64257;SDE&#64258;) on 
February 5, 2010 requesting a due process hearing. This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on February 8, 2010. On February
 24, 2010, the SDE advised the Hearing Officer that mediation 
with the parties was scheduled on March 9, 2010. On February 26, 2010, a prehearing conference was held with the Board&#8482;s attorney.  The Parents&#8482; 
attorney was not available.  The mailing date for 
the final decision was set at March 22, 2010. H
earing dates were agreed on for March 31, 2010 and 
April 2, 2010. The Board&#8482;s attorney requested an ex
tension of the mailing date for the final decision 
to April 26, 2010, which was granted. On March 10,

tponement of the hearing dates so that the 
parties could pursue settlement discussions, whic
h was granted.  The hearing was rescheduled to

2010, the Board&#8482;s attorney requested a postponemen
t of the April 27, 2010 hearing because of a 
scheduling conflict with another hearing on that date, which was granted.  The hearing was 
rescheduled to May 12, 2010 and the mailing date for the final decision was extended to June 7, 

2010. On May 7, 2010, the Board&#8482;s attorney advised th

a dismissal without prejudice of
 the hearing request.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: 
It is ordered that this case shall be dismissed without prejudice.
