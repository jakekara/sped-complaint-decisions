 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
   ISSUES:  1. Whether the conclusions of the manifest
ation determination were appropriate. 
 2. Whether the behavior that has resulted in the pending disciplinary action [expulsion] was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the Student&#8482;s disability; or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the Board&#8482;s failure to implement the IEP. 
 SUMMARY:   Disciplinary proceedings are pending for th
e tenth grade Student for alleged possession 
of marijuana with intent to sell at the Board hi
gh school.  As the Student had been eligible for 
special education at the time of the incident, a 
manifestation determination meeting convened.  
The Board determined that the conduct which re
sulted in the pending disciplinary action was not a manifestation of the Student&#8482;s 
disability.  The Parents requested this hearing to challenge the 
manifestation determination.  

 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  The Parents requested this hearing on April 11, 2008.  The hearing convened on May 1, and the hearing continued to May 8 so that counsel for both parties had an opportunity to file briefs.    
This decision is issued within 10 school days of closing of the evidentiary hearing and receipt of briefs in accordance with 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415. 
 
The Parents&#8482; witnesses were the Father an
d Dr. George Chapar, the Student&#8482;s treating psychologist.
