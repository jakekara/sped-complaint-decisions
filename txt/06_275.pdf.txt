  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
   PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  Case #06-141 was requested on May 30, 2006, and a pre-hearing conference was held on June 7, 2006.  The hearing was scheduled for July 11, 2006, and the deadline for mailing 
the final decision and order was August 13, 2006.  The parties engaged in mediation on 
July 11, requesting that the hearing be postponed to allow for settlement negotiations.  
That request was granted, and the hearing was re-scheduled for September 12, 2006.   
 A partial settlement was achieved, but Pa
rents then requested a second hearing on September 6, 2006, and asked that the two hearin
g be consolidated.  The hearing officer, in consultation with the hearing officer assigned to the second case (#06-275), agreed to consolidate the two cases and notified the pa
rties of the need fo
r another pre-hearing conference prior to convening the consolidated hearing.  The hearing was again postponed.  The Board filed a motion for cl
arification and a mo
tion to contest the sufficiency of the complaint for case #06-275 on September 12, 2006. 
 On September 26, 2006, the attorney represen
ting the Parents filed a motion to be 
allowed to withdraw from both cases, because
 of &#64257;irreconcilable differences concerning 
the management of the cases.&#64258;  The hearing 
officer granted this motion, and wrote to the 
Parents concerning the status of the two cases.  She suggested that they could either go forward, Pro se, or engage another attorney, or they could withdraw the requests for hearings and re-file when they were ready.  The hearing officer extended the deadline for responding to the Board&#8482;s motions to Octobe
r 25, 2006, to allow time to consider these 

options.  The hearing officer also encouraged another mediation session.
