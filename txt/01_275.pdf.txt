A prehearing conference was held on August 24. The parties wished to mediate the case first. The Parents filed a motion to extend the decision deadline from October 1 to November 10, which was granted. The hearing was scheduled for October 24 and 30. The Parents and Board respectively filed hearing exhibits and witness lists with the Hearing Officer. On October 11, the Parents retained Attorney Klebanoff to represent them. On October 24, the parties and their attorneys appeared and indicated that they wished to discuss possible settlement prior to starting the hearing. After approximately two hours, the parties indicated on the record that they had reached an agreement and requested until October 29 in which to reduce the agreement to writing and withdraw the case. On October 29, the Parents&#8482; attorney asked to postpone the October 30 hearing for two weeks for the purpose of finalizing the agreement and withdrawing the hearing request. The request was granted, the case was rescheduled for November 16 and the deadline for decision was extended to November 30. The Hearing Officer postponed the November 16 hearing because of illness and rescheduled it for December 4. The decision deadline was extended to December 6. On December 3, the Board&#8482;s attorney requested a postponement because the business manager and auditor had been out of town and had not approved the agreement. The Parents&#8482; attorney joined in the request. The Hearing Officer granted the request, extended the decision deadline to December 31 and ordered that the Parents should withdraw the case on or before
