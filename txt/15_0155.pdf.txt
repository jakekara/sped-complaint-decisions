FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Did the Board violate child ﬁne by not identifying the Student as requiring special education and
related services in a timely manner?

2. Was the program offered by the Board for the 2013—2014 school year appropriate and did it
provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE)?

3. Was the program offered by the Board for the 2014-2015 school year appropriate and did it
provide the Student with FAPE in the LRE?

4. Is the unilateral placement of the Student at Winston Preparatory School, for the 2014-2015 school
year, appropriate and does it provide the Student a meaningful education?

5. Does the Student require an extended school year (ESY) for the 2014-2015 school year in order to
receive FAPE?

6. Should the Board reimburse the Student for his unilateral placement at Winston Preparatory
School for the 2014—2015 school year?

7, Is the Student entitled to compensatory education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Emotional Disturbance and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned
in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and
Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the
Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2014-2015 school year. The Parents requested
placement at Winston Preparatory School for the 2014-2015 school year. The Board refused the Parents
request. On September 19, 2014, the Board received notice of the Parents request for due process. The
parties agreed to forge a resolution meeting and mediate the matter. The mediation date was October 2,
2014; the mediation was not successful.
