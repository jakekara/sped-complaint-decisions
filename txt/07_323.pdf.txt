tent with Regulations implementing the IDEIA and 
the Federal Educational Records Privacy Act, 34 CFR &#167; 300.32(d), which protect dissemination of 

&#64257;personally identifiable&#64258; information of the child wh
o is the subject of an IDEIA proceeding (the 

&#64257;Student&#64258;), the Hearing Officer has concluded that to 
protect the Student&#8482;s privacy interests in addition to 
masking the names of the Student and her family members, it is necessary to use pseudonyms to mask the 

identity of the local educational agency (&#64257;LEA&#64258;) at issue, and the 
names of teachers, certain other 
witnesses, certain entities and locations and one reported
 Court decision involving the LEA at issue.  That 
case will be referred to herein as 
Student v. RDZ
, and did not involve the Student in this case.  The parties 
have been provided with a list that matches the pseudon
ym used in this Final Decision and Order with the 
name of each individual, entity or location and that reported case.
