FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Are the four evaluations (FBA/BIP) with ecological assessment added on],
occupational therapy, speech and language, and psycho-educational) completed
with the Student, by the Shelton Board of Education, appropriate and do they
meet the state and federal requirements for evaluations under the IDEIA?

2. If the answer to Issue No.1 is NO, are the Parents entitled to public funding for
”Independent Educational Evaluations of those four areas?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Shelton Board of Education (“Board”) ﬁled the request for a due process hearing on
September 8, 2014 in response to a request from the Parents to be reimbursed at public
expense, for a series of independent educational evaluations in the areas of FBA/BIP;
occupational therapy; speech and language; and psycho-educational. The Board believes
that its’ own evaluations meet the requirements of the IDEA. A prehearing conference
was held on October 2, 2014, from which the issues listed above were identiﬁed. Initial
hearing dates were set for December 5 and December 10, 2014. On November 26, 2014,
the Board indicated that the Parties were in the process of ﬁnalizing an agreement
reached at mediation and would like to postpone the December 5, 2014 hearing date. The
request was granted. On December 4, 2014, Counsel for the Board withdrew the request
for due process hearing.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

With the Withdrawal of the complaint by the Board on December 4, 2014, and with no
further issues to be decided, this matter is DISMISSED, without prejudice.
