        Appearing on behalf of the Board:      Dr. Jane H. Currie 
      Director of Special Services 
      Farmington Public Schools

Appearing before:     Attorney Christine B. Spak 
Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER    The request for due process in this matter was filed by the Board for reason that the 
Parent was requesting an independent neuropsychological evaluation followed by the 
neuropsychologist developing and monitoring 
the Student&#8482;s program. The Parent also 
wanted a one-to-one aide for the one and one-half hours that the Student did not have 

additional adult supervision. The Board rejected these requests maintaining that the 
Student was doing well in the program as currently designed and implemented.  The date 

for mailing of the final decision was set at March 21, 2005.  At the prehearing conference 
the Board advised that the Parent had obtained assistance from the Office of Protection 
and Advocacy and was agreeing to address the issues through the PPT process.  The 
Board was therefore withdrawing their request for due process and the matter could be 
dismissed.  
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The hearing is dismissed.
