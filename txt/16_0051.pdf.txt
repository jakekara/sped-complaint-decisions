SUMMARY:

This case involves a child who was enrolled for the ﬁrst time in the Greenwich Public School
District during the 2013-2014 academic year for her sophomore year. In the second semester of
tenth grade, Student experienced the sudden onset of debilitating migraine headaches. Student’s
headaches were so severe that she was hospitalized for inpatient treatments on multiple
occasions in 2014. As a result of her severe migraine headaches, Student had extensive absences
both from individual classes, on those days she was able to make it into school, and for entire
days, when she was not well enough to attend school at all. While Student achieved academic
success during her ﬁrst semester, the absences due to her illness in the semester that followed

 

March 3, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0051

negatively impacted Student’s academic achievement. Greenwich Public School District violated
its child find obligations when it failed to identify Student as a student who should be referred
for special education, and erred when it determined Student did not qualify for special education
under the category of Other Health Impairment.

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes (C.G.S.)
§10-—76h and related regulations, 20 United States Code §1415(f) and related regulations, and in
accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (U.A.P.A.), C.G.S. §§4-176e to
4-178, inclusive, §§4-181a and 4-186.

FINDINGS OF F ACT:

After considering all of the evidence submitted by the Parties, including documentary evidence
and testimony of witnesses, 1 ﬁnd the following facts:

1. Student is 18 years of age and has given her Father an educational power of attorney to
exercise her educational rights. (Joint Stipulation)

2. Student attended a private elementary school, Greenwich Country Day School (“GCDS”)
through the end of ninth grade, which is the highest grade offered by that school.
(Testimony of Father, 12/4/2015; Joint Stipulation) Student received mostly B grades while
attending GCDS, and in her last year made the honor roll twice. (B-2, p. 2, P-73, P—74)

3. While attending Greenwich Countiy Day School Student did not suffer from migraine
headaches. (Testimony of F ather, 12/4/2015). Student did at one point suffer from a virus
which caused her to be absent from GCDS for a period of 20 days. (B—19, p. 199) GCDS
also reported some absences relating to Parents’ divorce. (Testimony of Guidance
Counselor, 11/4/2015).

4. Parents enrolled Student in Greenwich High School (“GHS”) for her sophomore year in
August of 2013. (Testimony of Father, 12/4/2015)

5. Greenwich High School has approximately 2700 students. (Testimony of GHS House
Administrator, 11/24/2015) GHS has a bell system to signal the transitions between classes.
This bell system has to be loud enough so that the students passing in the hall and in the
student center can hear it over the conversations of hundreds of students. Father’s
testimony regarding the layout and physical environment of GHS were not credited. This
Hearing Ofﬁcer found Father’s expressions of shock and dismay in discovering that the
hallways of a high school with 2700 students would be loud and full of students during
class transition time to be disingenuous. F ather’s hyperbolic testimony about “sirens” and
“Grand Central Station” suggested a belief that the architect of the Greenwich High School
was expected to have known that Father’s child would enroll there at some point decades
after construction and be afﬂicted with migraines and that the architect’s failure to design a
the building contemplating that eventuality was a personal affront. GHS is a large school
with a lot of high school students moving throughout the building during the day. The
Hearing Ofﬁcer takes administrative notice that most teenagers are not by nature quiet and
retiring creatures and that when congregating in hallways and at lunch, the noises teenagers
emit tend to increase exponentially.

Student’s cumulative grade point average (“GPA”) after the ﬁrst quarter of the 2013—2014
school year was a 3.4, while her GPA for the marking period was 3.49. (P—3) Student
received Cs in her Advanced Placement courses of Language and Composition and US
History, a C+ in Honors Algebra, an A+ in Chemistry, a B+ in Italian and As in the rest of
her courses. (1d.)

On November 15, 2013, Student was chosen as “Student of the Marking Period” by the
GHS Science department, for her consistent effort, strong work ethic and positive attitude
toward learning. (P-4)

1n the second quarter of her sophomore year, Student made the honor roll and her
cumulative grade point average (“GPA”) year was a 3.47, while her GPA for the marking
period was a 3.8. (P-6, P—73) Student had raised her grades in her Advanced Placement
courses of Language and Composition and US History to a B-. She again earned an A+ in
Chemistry and a B+ in Italian. Student received a C in Honors Algebra and As in the rest of
her courses. (P-6)

The AP US History Course at GHS is broken into two parts with a ﬁnal grade assigned for
each semester. (P-6) Student received a C+ as a ﬁnal grade for the AP US History I. (P-6)
Student took the PSAT during her sophomore year and scored in the 99th percentile for
critical reading, the 93rd percentile for mathematics and the 79th percentile for writing
skills. (P—1(b), p.2)

Upon enrolling in GHS, Student was assigned to a Guidance Counselor, as one of the
Guidance Counselor’s caseload of around 170 students. (Testimony of Guidance
Counselor)

At the time of the hearing the Guidance Counselor had been employed by the District for 8
years and had participated in numerous PPT meetings, although she could not provide an
exact number. (Testimony of Guidance Counselor) The Guidance Counselor had also
participated in around 30 Section 504 meetings. (1d.)

The Guidance Counselor took a course in education law during her graduate program and a
portion of this course covered special education law. (Testimony of Guidance Counselor)
Student did not have many absences during her ﬁrst semester at GHS. (Testimony of
Guidance Counselor, 11/4/2015; P-6, p. 1, B-17, p.2)

GHS employs three full time nurses, who provide medical care in the GHS Health Ofﬁce.
(Testimony of School Nurse, 12/18/2015) Students who present with general headaches at
the Health Ofﬁce are assessed to determine the cause of the headache, Whether it is due to
stress, illness or concussion. (1d,)

Once the Health Ofﬁce is aware that a student suffers from migraines, the Health Ofﬁce
staff usually follows a protocol of administering medications, if they have been prescribed,
and providing a dark and quiet area to rest unti1 the medication takes effect and the
migraine resolves. 1n the event the migraine does not resolve, the nurse will discuss the
next steps with the Student or call the Student’s Parent (Testimony of School Nurse,
12/18/2015)

Student went to the Health Ofﬁce only once for a headache between the start of school in
August of 2013 and December 12, 2013. (B—18, p. 5)

On December 13, 2013, Student visited the Health Ofﬁce during the school day as a result
ofa headache. (B-18, p. 5)

Father testiﬁed that the Student’s medical condition of chronic migraine headaches began

abruptly in J anuary of 2014. (Testimony of Father, 12/4/2015; P—15, P-83) This testimony
was contradicted by his email dated March 2015 in which he stated that the migraine
headaches started on F ebruary 19, 2014. (B—19, p. 199)

Beginning in February 2014, Student’s Visits to the GHS Health Ofﬁce as a result of her
headaches during school increased signiﬁcantly. (B—18 pp. 5—7) Student was absent due to
illness 25 times in the period between January 2, 2014 and June 2, 2014. (B—17)

When Student came to the Health Ofﬁce she appeared uncomfortable; the protocol
followed, including the administration of medication, did not assist her in feeling better.
(Testimony of School Nurse, 12/18/2015; B—18 p. 8)

On March 12, 2014, an interim report of Student’s progress for the third marking period
was generated. (P—I 1) At the time of the interim report, Student’s grades in both of her AP
courses had declined to a C—. (Id) Student’s AP Language and Composition teacher noted
Student was missing assignments. Student’s Honors Algebra 2, AP US Histoiy, and Art
teacher selected “Frequent absence/tardiness is affecting learning” as a comment to include
in the comment section. (1d,) At the time of the interim report, Student was receiving an
incomplete in Honors Algebra 2 and her Art teacher indicated she was in danger of failing
and losing credit due to frequent absences. (Id)

On March 13, 2014, a letter was sent to Parents by the GHS House Administrator notifying
them that as of March 7, 2014, Student had “...accumulated a signiﬁcant number of
absences and/or tardies in one or more of her classes.” (P-76, p. 1) The letter also indicated
that according to the GHS school attendance policy, both excused and unexcused absences
count toward loss of credit (1d) Student was ﬁve absences away from loss of credit in
Chemistry and AP US History, four absences away from loss of credit in Honors Algebra 2
and Italian, seven absences away from loss of credit in AP Language and Composition, and
had met the threshold for loss of credit in her Lettering and Layout Art class and would
lose credit if she was absent one more time. (1d,) This document is generated automatically
by the computerized attendance system and was issued in accordance with the GHS
attendance policy. (Testimony of GHS Administrator, 11/24/2015, p.12)

On March 15, 2014, Student’s Math teacher reached out to Parents regarding Student’s
self-report 0f migraines and requesting further information in order to assist Student. (B-19,
p. 200)

On March 15, 2014, in response to the email from Student’s Math teacher, Mother sent an
email to Student’s teachers, Guidance Counselor, and GHS Administrator indicating the
focus was on identifying triggers and reﬁning treatment for Student. (B—19, p. 200) Mother
also indicated she was unaware the teachers had not been infonned of the reason for
Student’s absences, and let staff know that the school nurses had been informed about
Student’s condition. (1d.)

On March 15, 2014, Father also sent an email to GHS staff, in response to the Math
teacher’s email. (B-19, p.199) In this email he informed staff that Student’s migraines
began on February 19, 2014 and had persisted since then. (101.) Father informed staff that
Student was diagnosed with migraines by a pediatric neurology practice on Febiuary 24th,
2014 and had been seen again on March 6, 2014 and was scheduled to see the doctor again
on April 9, 2014. (Id.) Father indicated that make up tests and quizzes should be scheduled
directly with Student. (Id)

Father notiﬁed GHS staff that student’s medical condition had not improved and noted her
continued absences on March 26, 2014. (B-19, p. 195) Father speciﬁcally requested that
staff let Parents know what should be done in regard to making up lost work and stated
Parents were open to all suggestions, including tutoring. (1(1)

On March 26, 2014, the Guidance Counselor sent an email to Student’s teachers, informing
them that Student’s medical issues had not improved and that it was impacting her
academics. (B—l9, p.196) The Guidance Counselor indicated that she was inviting staff to a
meeting with parents (referred to in the GHS vernacular as a “stafﬁng”) on March 31, 2014
to discuss how to handle Student’s workload. (Id.) The Guidance Counselor indicated in
this email that a medical Section 504 accommodation plan might be needed if Student’s
migraines did not improve. (Id.)

On March 31, 2014, a “stafﬁng” meeting was held with Parents, Guidance Counselor, the
Alt teacher and the AP US History teacher, who suggested that Student attend morning
sessions that he holds for all students in order to go over information that students need to
review. (P—13) Student’s Art teacher indicated that she would provide materials for Student
to complete her projects at home because she was quite behind in class. (1d,)

Suggestions of teachers for assisting Student provided before and after the Stafﬁng meeting
included having the Student take an incomplete in Art to give her a month to make up
work, and to allow student to take home tests and waive all homework grades (representing
5% of grade) in Math. (B-9 , p. 185, and p. 195)

On April 2, 2014, the Guidance Counselor notiﬁed teachers via email that Student was
being admitted to the hospital in two days in order to receive medical treatment and
indicated that Student was too ill to attend school. (B—19, p. 196) In response to this email,
Student’s AP US History teacher expressed his concern that Student was missing major
units of study. (1d,)

On April 4, 2014, Student’s Pediatric Neurologist, Dr. Robeit Fryer, wrote a letter
addressed “To Whom It May Concern” regarding Student, which was emailed to the
Guidance Counselor 0n the same day. (P—83, B-19, p. 176) In this letter Dr. Fryer indicated
he had been following Student for the past several weeks and that Student suffers from
migraines which started abruptly in J anuary of 2014. (1d,) He also indicated that the
Student was currently in the hospital for an intravenous medication protocol. The date the
migraines began contained in the pediatric neurologist’s letter was contradicted by F ather’s
email to school, which predated the pediatric neurologist’s letter, and is deemed by the
Hearing Ofﬁcer to be an error by the pediatric neurologist based on inaccurate reporting to
the pediatric neurologist by Father. (B—19, p. 199)

In the April 4, 2014 letter, the Dr. Fryer requested that Student’s recent absences,
beginning J away 4, 2014, be excused and that Student be evaluated for a Section 504 plan
because future absences due to her medical condition were likely. (1d.) The doctor also
predicted that Student could miss potentially as much as two weeks of school. (1d,)

On April 6, 2014, Mother reached out to Guidance Counselor to ask if anything else was
needed for the 504 plan. (B-l9, p. 176) Mother asked in this communication if Parents
should be looking into getting tutors for Student and asking about having another meeting.
(1d)

On April 7, 2014, Guidance Counselor sent an email to Parents indicating that the letter
from the pediatric neurologist did not contain a recommendation that Student be given

extra time for assignments or assessments. (B-19, p. 176) She went on to express her
concern that failure to contain this recommendation might result in Student not receiving
accommodations from the College Board. (Id.)

The Guidance Counselor and Mother also met in person on April 7, 2014 and Guidance
Counselor suggested that the letter include that Student needs extra time to complete
assignments and assessments and a recommendation to break down the requirements for
her standardized or timed test so that they could be taken at a minimum over a longer time
period and/or over multiple days. (B-l9, p. 178)

On April 7, 2014, Dr. Fiyer’s ofﬁce asked Parents to provide the language Parents were
seeking be added to the April 4, 2014 letter. (B-l9, pp. 177—178)

On April 9, 2014, Dr. Fryer drafted a revised letter containing the following additional
information: “In order to prevent [Student] from falling further behind after missing so
many weeks of school, the 504 plan should include accommodations such as extra time on
tests, quizzes and homework assignments. I would also like to request that she be given
extended time on the standardized tests such as the AP exams (normal time + 50%), or that
the tests be given over multiple days.” (P—15gB-18 p. 43)

On April 10, 2014, Mother forwarded Dr. Fryer’s April 9, 2014 revised letter to Guidance
Counselor, stating “Hopefully this sufﬁces to get that 504 plan moving”. (B-19, p. 179)
Later that day Guidance Counselor developed a Section 504 accommodation plan and sent
it to Parents via email with the request that they sign and return it to her so that she could
send it to the teachers and to College Board with the doctor’s note. (Joint Stipulation, B-19,
p.179) Both Parents signed and returned the document that day. (B-19. R179)

The April 10, 2014 Section 504 accommodation plan for Student indicates that Student’s
disability of chronic major headaches substantially limited Student’s major life activities of
learning and caring for one’s self. (B—1 8 p. 16) The Guidance Counselor, Student’s AP US
History Teacher, Parents and Student are listed as members of the Section 504
Multidisciplinaiy Team. (1d,) The Section 504 accommodation plan also notes Student is
unable to perform any cognitive functions without difﬁculty and that the ﬁnding of a
limitation is based on the note from Student’s pediatric neurologist. (Id.) Accommodations
for Student under this plan included a modiﬁed workload as Student managed headaches,
extra time to complete assignments when Student is absent, waiver of the attendance policy
and extended time of time and a half for Student when completing tests and quizzes. (1d.)
Both Parents signed this plan on April 10, 2014. (Id) The accommodation plan does not
include any special education services or counseling and these accommodations were not
discussed or offered by the Guidance Counselor. (Joint Stipulation)

Student was not evaluated pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act at any time
during her enrollment in the District, nor was she referred to Special Education during the
2014—2015 school year. (Joint Stipulation)

On April 21, 2014, Student began to see Dr. Silverman, a psychologist, for counseling. (B-
19, p.181) F ather informed the school and authorized communication between counselor
and school. (Id.) Student continued to see Dr. Silverman through June of 2014 and resumed
upon her return from camp in the ﬁrst week of August. (Testimony of Father, 12/8/2015, p.
9) Although Father claimed Guidance Counselor only made one effort to reach Dr.
Silverman (Testimony of F ather, 12/8/2015), the record reﬂects that Dr. Silverman and
Guidance Counselor had difﬁculty connecting by phone and that Dr. Silverman did not

 

March 3, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0051

respond to a detailed email sent by Guidance Counselor on September 10, 2014.
(Testimony of Guidance Counselor, 11/4/2015;B—19, p.92A and p.928)

43. On April 22, 2014, Mother informed the Guidance Counselor and AP teachers that Parents
had hired a tutor from GCDS to help Student catch up on missed work and prepare for the
College Board exam. B-19, p. 101)

44. As of April 24, 2015, Student’s absences had resulted in her not being in a position to
receive credit for AP US History — (Second Semester Course) or AP Language and
Composition. (B-19, p. 183) Student’s AP Language and Composition teacher proposed
that Student take an incomplete for the second semester, so that she could complete work
over the summer and not have to repeat the course. (B-19, p.184) Neither AP teacher
recommended Student take the AP exams. (B—19, p. 182)

45. At some point prior to April 25, 2014, Student was placed on a special circumstance
attendance list which exempted her from application of the GHS attendance policy. (B-19,
p.183)

46. On April 25, 2014, the Guidance Counselor again noted that student’s absences are
affecting her academically and will continue to do so. (B-19, p. 183)

47. On April 25, 2014, Mother met with GHS House Administrator, who suggested to Mother
other accommodations for Student including arranging Student’s schedule so that she starts
later in the day or potentially enrollment in the CLP program, in the event pain from noise
in the Student Center and the class changing bells continues to be intolerable. (B-19, p.
172) Mother informed GHS staff by email that Parents were looking into programs offered
by the Greenwich Education Group, which offers a range of private educational programs
and services and were likely to choose intensive tutoring focusing on preparation for the
AP exams. (Id.)

48. On April 25, 2014, AP US History teacher informed Mother that he is not entirely sure of
how she can get caught up in time to take the AP Exam and indicated that she will be at a
signiﬁcant disadvantage if she takes the test in the 2013-2014 school year instead of the
following year. (B—19, p. 173) Parents chose to have Student go forward and take the test
anyway. (B-19, p. 172A)

49. During the hearing the AP US Histmy teacher indicated that he had given Student a grade
of A as a message of encouragement to Student and that this grade did not accurate1y
reﬂect Student’s achievement. (Testimony of AP US History teacher, December 4, 2015)

50. A11 three teachers testiﬁed that missing classroom instruction negatively impacted
Student’s academic performance. (Testimony of AP US Histmy, 12/4/2015, GHS Honors
Algebra 11 teacher, 12/4/2015, AP Language and Composition teacher, 12/4/2015).

51. As of April 29, 2014, Student had missed three major units of study in AP US History. (B-
19, 174)

52. On Apri1 30, 2014, Father informed Guidance Counselor and AP teachers, that Student
might be entering the hospital again that week and that he would keep staff informed. (B—
19-p. 174)

53. On May 13, 2014, Guidance Counselor expressed concern to Parents regarding the amount
of absences Student has accumulated after talking to the school nurse. (B-19, p.158) The
Guidance Counselor stated that Student is missing valuable class time and that the
Guidance Counselor is unsure that working with the tutor would be effective, as she is

unsure of Student’s level of concentration given her difﬁculty sustaining attention and
focus in class. (B-19 p. 158)

On May 14, 2014, Mother sent an email to guidance counselor stating Parents are ready for
the next step and want a more tangible handle on what needs to be done and what can be
done before the end of the year and whether outside help is necessary or recommended. (B-
19, p. 160)

On May 15, 2014 F ather again repeated his offer to arrange for tutoring in any subject if
that was needed for Student to successfully complete her coursework. (B-l9, p. 163)
Guidance Counselor responded that when she has information from all of the teachers and
speaks to administrators she will an‘ange a meeting about Student and how to proceed
going forward. (Id)

As of May 19, 2014, Student had missed the last four major unit exams in AP US History.
(13-19, p. 155)

On May 20th 2014 the AP Language and Composition teacher indicated she was changing
the third marking period grade from an incomplete to a C- indicating that Student had
really received a D. (B-19, p, 165) She also indicated that Student was receiving an F for
her progress report because it appeared she was not attempting to make up work. (13-19,
p.165)

On May 21, 2014, Father reported Parents are continuing to seek the trigger for Student’s
migraines but that the noise at the high school has not been bothering Student as much. (B-
19, p. 156)

On May 22, 2014, Guidance Counselor reported to Parents about Student’s progress in her
courses. (B—19, p.153) As of this, Student was caught up in Chemistry and had one
makeup test in Math outstanding. The Guidance Counselor had not yet received
information from the Social Studies department head about Student repeating the second
semester. (Id) The AP English teacher also indicated it was premature to make a decision
about whether or not Student would need to have work extend past the school year. (Id.)
Student’s attendance in May and June of 2014 showed improvement. In May she was
absent for two days and in June only once. (B-l7, p.1)

As of June 10, 2014, Student was on track to receive credit for all of her courses except AP
US History Second semester. The department head for Social Studies had not made a
determination of how Student’s failure to complete work for the second semester of AP US
History would be addressed in Student’s junior year. (B-19, pp. 132-134, 140)

Beginning in late August 2014, Student’s chronic migraine headaches became and
remained at a moderate to severe level. (B—18, p.11) On the ﬁrst day of school, August 26,
2015, Student had a severe migraine and was unable to attend school. (Testimony of
Father, 12/8/2015, B-19, pp. 121—124.)

On Friday August 29, 2014, Guidance counselor emailed the school nurse to relay her
concern that Student’s pattern of absences would be repeated this year. (B-19, p. 121)

On September 2, 2014, Student was admitted to the hospital again in order to receive an
intravenous treatment, which failed to abort her headaches and made them worse.
(Testimony of Father, 12/8/2015, p. 13; B-18, p.11) Student was discharged on September
4, 2014. (Testimony of Father, 12/8/2015, p.18)

The Guidance Counselor requested and received a release for school to speak to Student’s
physician. (B—19, p. 115) Student was added to a list of Students to be discussed at a
meeting held weekly to discuss students of concern. (Id.)

The School Nurse spoke with Student’s doctor on Thursday, September 4, 2014.
(Testimony of School Nurse, 12/ 18/2014; B-18, pp. 8-9) During this conversation,
Student’s doctor informed the School Nurse that Student was currently in the hospital
receiving intravenous medication and that he believed Student would be able to return to
school the following Monday. (Id.) Student’s doctor also indicated that Student should be
allowed to rest when needed in nurse’s ofﬁce, might need medications at school to be taken
as needed and that he would be speaking with Parents regarding lightening Student’s
workload to reduce stress. (Id)

On September 4, 2014, after her phone conversation with Student’s Doctor, the School
Nurse faxed a blank GHS Authorization for the Administration of Medicines by School
Personnel to his ofﬁce in the event new medications were prescribed along with an
invitation to send a list of any accommodations Student might need. (Testimony of School
Nurse, 12/18/2014; B-18 pp. 8—9)

The following day, September 5, 2014, the School Nurse attended an informal meeting
with Mother and Student’s Guidance Counselor during which a follow up meeting was
planned for September 9, 2014 to address Student’s course load and accomodations.
(Testimony of School Nurse, 12/18/2014; B-18 pp. 8—9)

The Guidance Counselor scheduled a meeting for September 9, 2014 in order to discuss a
plan on how to proceed and invited Parents and the nurse to attend. (B-l9, p.102) It is
notable that Father strenuously objected to Mother’s presence at the meeting asserting
(despite several documents and email correspondence submitted during the hearing which
proved to the contrary) that Mother was incapable of being on the “same page”. (B—19, p.
103) F ather’s position on attending a joint parent meeting because he claimed “...it takes
much longer for [Mother] to absorb the information in a meeting, wrecking the process for
me.” was unreasonable and an indication of the lack of regard Father has for Mother. (B-
19, p.104) Father’s disregard for the mother of his child was evident throughout the
hearing and documented in the exhibits. Father didn’t feel that Mother’s input on the
behavior ratings scale was necessary and that his opinion alone should sufﬁce. (B-19, p.
44) The evidence indicates the disdain and anger towards Mother is an ongoing issue, in
fact Mother felt that in order to manage Father’s emotions at the September 9, 2014
meeting, she would have to remain silent. (B-19, p.105) When a letter addressed to Mother
went to Father’s home, Father went so far as to tell GHS staff that he was the lead on this
matter and all communications should be directed to him, with a copy to [Mother] if
needed (emphasis added). (B—19, p. 43) Father’s statements and the exhibits indicate that
Student, when living with her Father, was experiencing the stress of living with someone
who has a lot of animosity towards her Mother.

Student has been exposed to the stress of coming from a divorced home over the years.
(Testimony Spire School Life Coach, 12/15/2015; B-19, p.105)

The school nurse notes of the September 9, 2014 meeting indicate there was discussion at
this meeting of Student’s migraine pain and her medication. (B-18, p.8) Acupuncture and
meditation were discussed as complementary approaches to her medical treatment. (1d) At
this meeting Student’s headache triggers were reported as noise, stress and the high altitude

at camp. (1d,) The nurse referred Parent to doctor for further suggestions. (Id) Homebound
tutoring was suggested at this meeting, as was the Greenwich Alternative High School.
(1d) ’

F ather testiﬁed that he viewed an Assessment and Achievement Report around the time
Parents were trying to ﬁgure out what to do about Student on the 10th of September, 2014.
(Testimony of F ather, 12/8/2015, pp. 21-22; P—70) This was not possible because the
document was not generated until September 10, 2015. (1d.) Father also indicated that at
the meeting he had with Guidance Counselor on September 9, 2015, the Guidance
Counselor had not recommended the Greenwich Alternative High School program so he
thought GAHS was not appropriate for Student. (Testimony of Father 12/ 8/2015, p.20-
p.21) This statement is controverted by Father’s rejection of the program in his email to
GHS staff on September 11, 2015. (P-28, p. 23) If the program was not discussed as an
option to be explored, there was no need for Father to reject it.

On September 10, 2014, Guidance Counselor met with Student and adjusted her schedule
so that she would have no early classes as Parents had expressed that mornings were more
difﬁcult for her. (B-l9, p. 98) Leading up to the meetings in September, the Guidance
Counselor expressed concern about Student’s enrollment in AP classes, feeling those
classes were too challenging. (Testimony of Guidance Counselor)

On September 1 1, 2014, Guidance Counselor informed Parents she would be introducing
Student to the GHS school psychologist the following day so that she could provide
additional support to Student. (B—l9, p 84)

On September 11, 2014, F ather wrote an email to Guidance Counselor in which he notiﬁed
her that Student was undergoing an evaluation by a neuropsychologist. (B—19, p. 83).
Further, be indicated Parents were rejecting home tutoring based on input from the
neuropsychologist and psychologist.(Testimony of Father 12/ 8/ 1 5, p. 30; B—19, p.84)
Father also indicated he was rejecting the alternative high school because of the “stigma of
having to participate in an alternative program along with individuals who in some cases
cannot function in a normal school environmen ” and rejecting the self—contained program
at GHS because it lacked the level of academics Parents felt Student could achieve.
(Testimony of Father 12/8/15, 8—19, p.84). Father also indicated that a schedule requiring
Student to wake up before 9:00 AM made her headaches worse. (Id) Father indicated in
this email that Parents were exploring alternatives for Student and that she would not be in
school for rest of the week and the following week. (B-19, p. 83)

Student never returned to take classes at GHS.

On September 16, 2014, Father gave notice to the Board of Parents’ intent to unilaterally
place Student at the Spire School. (Joint Stipulation, B—l9, p.84)

On September 18, 2014, the GHS House Administrator sent separate letters identical in
content to both Parents in which she acknowledged receipt of the notice to unilaterally
place Student and offered to hold a Planning and Placement Team Meeting. (B—l9, pp. 81-
82)

A PPT meeting was scheduled for and held on September 29, 2014. (B-Z, p. 1) The stated
purpose of the PPT meeting was to “respond to unilateral placement”. (Joint Stipulation, B—
2 p.1) Both Parents attended this meeting as did a regular education teacher, a special
education teacher, a GHS School Psychologist, the Guidance Counselor, a school nurse, the

District’s Program Coordinator, the F amily’s Advocate and the GHS House Administrator.
(Id)

On September 28, 2014, GHS received a letter from clinical psychologist Dr. Randall
Weeks, whom Parents had retained to do a neuropsychological evaluation regarding
Student’s headaches. (J 0th Stipulation, P-3 8) This letter contained a statement that
patients with migraine headaches tend to be hypersensitive to sensory stimulation from
their environment and identiﬁed sounds as potential in‘itants and/or triggering factors for
pain. (P-38) The clinical psychologist also indicated Student’s repmted noise as
“problematic for her with respect to her head pain.” (Id.)

At some point between September 30, 2015 and October 19, 2014, Dr. Weeks generated a
5 page neuropsychological evaluation in letter form which he sent to Student’s pediatric
neurologist, and which was copied to Student’s Spire School Life Coach and Therapist, Dr.
Silverman. (P—39) The date on the letter is September 29, 2015, but the report contains
reference to a meeting on September 30, 2014 so the date on the letter cannot be relied
upon. (P—39, p.4) Dr. Weeks administered the Rey Auditory Learning Test on which
Student scored in the 43rd percentile on the Distractor Task test, in the 54th percentile on
the Immediate Recall test and in the 92nd percentile on the Memory test. (P.39, p.3) Her
scores on the Rey Auditory Learning Test were described as quite good. (Id.) The Stroop
Neuropsychological Screening Test indicated adequate abilities. (Id.)

Dr. Weeks also administered the WAlS-IV. Student’s composite score put her in the high
average to superior range in all areas with the exception of Student’s processing speed
which was in the 50th percentile or average range. (P-39, p.3) Dr. Weeks speculated that
the relative weakness in processing could be the result of her head pain and fatigue as these
areas were tested at the end of a three hour session.(Id.)

Student’s score on the Wechsler Memory Scale—IV administered by Dr. Weeks was in the
9lst percentile in auditory memory, reﬂected excellent abilities in auditory and Verbal
memory and reﬂected no evidence of impairment or cognitive dysfunction. (P—39, p. 3)

Dr. Weeks also administered the Beck Depression Inventory-ll test which placed Student in
the mild level of subjective depression which was a reﬂection of how Student felt when she
had headaches. (P—39, p3) Student at the time of the test was also experiencing mild
hopelessness, which was a reﬂection of how Student felt as a result of her migraine
headaches. (P—39, pp.3—4)

Student’s score on the Thematic Apperception Test to evaluate the ﬂow of her verbal skills
and to examine the quality of Student’s abilities to organize and maintain ideas indicated
no problems in such abilities. (P-39, p. 4)

In his summary, Dr. Weeks stated “Basically, there were no areas of signiﬁcant
decline/impairment regarding [Student’s] current cognitive status.” (P-39, p.4)
Recommendations made by Dr. Weeks were for extended time and soft deadlines as well as
Student monitoring of study efﬁciency with frequent breaks as necessary to maximize
learning and retention.

When the Family Advocate informed the PPT on September 29, 2014 that a
neuropsychological evaluation had been completed by a doctor at the New England
Institute for Neurology and Headache, a copy of the report was requested by the
administrator. (B —2 p.2.) F ather indicated the report had not yet been ﬁnalized. (Id.) The

PPT requested that evaluation be provided when it was completed. (1d,) The evaluation
was not received by the District until October 19, 2014. (P-39)

Consent forms permitting staff to speak with the clinical psychologist who conducted the
neuropsychological evaluation and consent to evaluate forms were given to Parents at the
PPT meeting, which Parents chose not to sign at that time. (B—2, p.2) Father and Mother
subsequently gave their consent to evaluate on October 12, 2014 and October 13, 2014
respectively. (B-2 pp. 10—11)

The PPT determined that the Student was not eligible for special education at the
September 29, 2014 meeting and refused Parents’ request for specialized instruction,
basing these decisions on the existence of Student’s “active 504 plan”, as well as the letter
from Student’s pediatric neurologist dated 9/4/2014 and a review of records on 9/29/2014.
(13-2, p-6)

Although the PPT declined to ﬁnd the Student eligible for special education, there were
discussions of about what the District was doing and could do in addition to address the
needs of the Student in the regular education setting. (B-2 p. 2) The Guidance Counselor
reviewed the 504 plan from the prior academic year (2013-2014) and discussed a proposal
to have Student start school at 9:30 am. instead of the normal start time. (B—2 p. 13) It was
noted that the late start time would not apply to two blocks of Precalculus and that if
Student was not able to make Precalculus on those days, there was a plan in place to
provide Student with the ability to make up work in the math learning center. (B—2 p. 2)
Parents stated their objection to homebound instruction at this meeting, believing it would
be too isolating. (Id.) The school nurse had previously heard from Dr. Fryer that
homebound instinction was not recommended. (B-19, p.92B)

The agenda for the September 29, 2014 PPT meeting which was created by the GHS House
Administrator speciﬁcally contemplated discussion of Student’s cun‘ent 504 plan and
potential addition of accommodations to that plan. (B-19, p. 70)

Although no documentation was submitted during the hearing to indicate that an invitation
was sent to Parents for a 504 meeting on 12/10/2014, Staff discussed adding
accommodations to Student’s 504 plan including the addition of counseling 1 time per
week to focus on coping skills and managing stress and having Student wear ear buds or an
alternate noise reduction device such as noise cancelling headphones during passing time
and at the start of class to block out the sound of the school bell. (B—2 p. 2; B -l9, 70) The
team also discussed permitting Student to leave class early to avoid the noise in the halls
when the student body transitions to the next class and alternatives to eating lunch in the
student center. (B—2, p. 2)

At some point a second Section 504 student accommodation plan was drafted by Student’s
Guidance Counselor which contained a yearly review date of September 29, 2014. (B—3 pp.
1-2) The document entered into evidence at the hearing was not signed by either Parent and
listed all of the attendees at the 9/29/2014 PPT as members of the Section 504
Multidisciplinary Team. (B8 p. 2) The recommendations in the Section 504
accommodation plan were changed to include counseling one time per week to focus on
coping skills and managing stress, earbuds/alternate noise reduction device during passing
time in hallway and at the start of class to reduce noise level, permitting Student to leave
class early to avoid noses during passing time, alternate setting for lunch and a modiﬁed
schedule with a later start time. (B—3, p. 1)

While Father testiﬁed at the hearing that Student was experiencing the stress of not being in
school and the stress of anticipating the noise at GHS, there was no evidence presented that
anticipating the noise and not being in school were stressors that were discussed with GHS
staff, although there was evidence that stress in general had been presented. (Testimony of
Father, 12/8/2015, p. 14)

The District staff decided at the September 29, 2014, PPT meeting to conduct a
multidisciplinary evaluation of Student based on the letter from Student’s pediatric
neurologist dated September 4, 2014 and a review of records. (B—2 p. 4)

Father signed the consent form allowing the school to obtain the neuropsychological
evaluation on October 8, 2014 and emailed to the GHS House Administrator. B—19, p. 65.
The contract for Student’s enrollment in the Spire School was executed by Father on
October 10, 2014, Mother on October 13, 2014 and the Spire School administrator on
October 14, 2014. (P-84, p.4)

The neuropsychological evaluation from Dr. Weeks was received by GHS on October 19,
2014. (Joint Stipulation, B-19, p. 68)

Attendance was a challenge for Student initially at the Spire School. Student was supposed
to start classes at the Spire School on October 20, 2014, but did not actually attend until
October 23, 2014. (B—19) Student attended 17 out of 30 school days in the period between
October 20, 2014 through December 4, 2015. (1d.)

On October 22, 2014, Dr. Fryer generated a third letter with an update on Student’s current
condition. (B—18) This letter was received by GHS on October 28, 2014. (Joint Stipulation)
The letter explicitly identiﬁed noise at all levels as a trigger for Student Which had the
potential to cause Student’s headaches to escalate in severity within minutes. (B-18, p. 11)
Dr. Fryer included in his letter recommendations that Student be placed in a program with
ﬂexible scheduling and with the least amount of noise and stress. (Id.) The doctor also
speciﬁed that class size should be limited to 6 students and that the environment be quiet
and free from loud or sudden noise. (Id.)

Earbuds were not recommended by Dr. Fryer in his October 22, 2014 letter because they
did not serve to protect a student from loud and piercing noises which can enter through the
tissue and bone surrounding the ear canal. (B—18, p.11) Similarly, noise cancelling
headphones remove background noise and do not shield the wearer from sudden noises.
(Id)

The District’s Initial Multidisciplinary evaluation of Student was conducted over four
different days in late November and early December 2014 and the Initial Multidisciplinary
Evaluation written report was issued on December 9, 2014. (Testimony of District
Evaluation Team School Psychologist, 12/18/2015; B—S)

The District’s Evaluation of Student also included an observation of Student in her
Precalculus class at the Spire School, which was conducted on December 4, 2016.
(Testimony of District Evaluation Team Special Education Teacher; B-SA, B-19)

At the time the PPT meeting was held on December 10, 2015, Student’s attendance at the
Spire School since enr011ment had been inconsistent. (Testimony of District Evaluation
Team Special Education Teacher; B—S) Student had attended only 14 0f the 31 school days
that had occurred since her enrollment. (B-S) On some of the 14 days she was able to
attend, she arrived late or left early which interfered with her ability to take advantage of
counseling sessions. (B-S)

The cognitive and achievement portions of the Initial Multidisciplinary Evaluation were
conducted by the Evaluation Team School Psychologist. (Testimony, Evaluation Team
School Psychologist; B—S) Student was observed by Evaluation Team Special Education
Teacher. (1d,) The GHS School Psychologist completed a developmental questionnaire
based on information received from Parents.

Student’s cognitive skills are in high average range with some areas within the normal
range. (Testimony of Evaluation Team School Psychologist; B—S pp. 4—7) Relative
weaknesses were identiﬁed in ﬂuency and some visual processing tasks, which, in contrast
to Student’s other scores, were in the lower end of the average range. (Id.)

Curiously, the results of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition
(“BASC-Z”) tests completed by Parents revealed that Mother had concerns about Student’s
functioning in several areas, including somatization, while Father rated Student as within
normal limits across all areas of social emotional and behavioral functioning except
Student’s ability to wake up in a timely manner. (B-S p. 13) The Hearing Ofﬁcer credits
Mother’s input on this instrument as it is more consistent with the evidence presented at the
hearing.

Student’s self—repmt on the BASC—2 indicated that she was in the clinically signiﬁcant area
of Somatization. Notably, Student also indicated that she sometimes feels her life is getting
worse and worse, that no one understands her, and that she experiences feelings of sadness.
(B—S p. 13) Student identified these feelings as resulting from her migraine headaches. (1d.)
The Initial Multidisciplinary Evaluation did not include any information from classroom
teachers who had Student in their classroom in the 2013—2014 school year. Testimony of
District Evaluation School Psychologist) Student’s absences and Student’s failure to
complete classwork were not mentioned in the Initial Multidisciplinary Evaluation. (Id.)
On December 10, 2014, another PPT Meeting was held. (J oint Stipulation, B-1 p. 2) In
attendance at this meeting were Father, the Family Advocate, the Greenwich District
Evaluation Team School Psychologist, the GHS administrator, the special education
teacher who had conducted the observation at the Spire School, the GHS school
psychologist, the Guidance Counselor, the School nurse, and the Greenwich School
District Director of Programs. (1d,) Father waived the attendance of a regular education
teacher. The purpose of this meeting was to review the evaluations and determine
eligibility. (1d.)

The PPT reviewed both the District’s Initial Multidisciplinary Evaluation and the
neuropsychological evaluation that had been completed since the last PPT meeting on
9/29/2014 and provided to the District. (B-l p. 3)

Disability categories considered for Student when making the eligibility determination
were Speciﬁc Learning Disability and Other Health Impairment (“OHI”). (Testimony of
District Evaluation School Psychologist) The PPT determined the Student was not eligible
for special education under either category and based this decision on classroom
observation in Student’s unilateral placement and on the District’s Initial Multidisciplinary
Evaluation. (B-l p. 5) Father disagreed with this decision. (J 0th Stipulation)

As pait of the eligibility determination, the GHS House Administrator led the team through
a GHS document called an Other Health Impairment Checklist and discussed whether or
not Student’s migraines impacted her social and emotional functioning. (Testimony of
GHS House Administrator,12/4/2014, Guidance Counselor, 11/4/2014; B-l p.3) Neither

the GHS House Administrator had strong recollections of what took place relative to
reviewing this checklist at the meeting. (ld.)

While the CHI form was discussed at the meeting, there is no record of it actually being
ﬁlled out. The Board did not provide a completed form in response to the records request or
at the hearing. (Testimony of Father, 12/8/2015) The blank form itself was provided upon
request of the Hearing Ofﬁcer. (P-80)

The PPT discussed the option of Student attending Greenwich Alternative High School
during the December 10, 2014 PPT meeting because they felt the program offered by
GAHS eould address the recommendations made by Student’s pediatric neurologist for a
smaller class setting and ﬂexible start times. (Testimony of District Evaluation Team
School Psychologist, 12/18/2014) (Id) The Greenwich Alternative High School program
has small class sizes, students can start later in the day, there are no bells at all; they go to
Chelsea Piers, they have access to online learning and students can take AP classes. There
is a full time counselor and a full time social worker at the school, as well as an opportunity
for Student to earn credits she may not be earning in her unilateral placement. (8-1 p. 4)
Students often attend for a semester or longer and earn a GHS diploma. (Id.)

Student’s transition schedule for her junior year at SPIRE schedule provided for her classes
to start at 9:00 am, with all but one ofthose classes being a study hall. (B—19, pp. 10-11)
Also Student met one on one with instwctors until she was up to speed in a course before
joining her classes. (Testimony Spire School Life Coach, 12/ 15/2015; B-19, p.105) This
approach allowed Student to transition successfully into classes with other Students.(ld.)
Father reported at the December 10, 2014 PPT meeting that Student is not bothered by the
chime system at the Spire School and that she uses noise cancelling headphones in a quiet
room. (B-l p. 3) F ather also reported that Student spent four weeks in the summer riding
horses in Wyoming and that she played volleyball and had also climbed the wall at Chelsea
Piers (Testimony of Father (12/8/2015 pp. 7—8); B—l p. 3). While in Wyoming, Student had
one major migraine and three to four lesser migraines. (Testimony of Father, 12/8/2015, p.
8)

Although the PPT indicated that Student’s evaluation and educational performance
demonstrated that Student did not require specialized instruction, District staff did note that
Student would beneﬁt from having extended time and counseling which they noted was to
be provided to Student under Student’s Section 504 plan. (B-l pp. 3 and 5)

The Greenwich School District Director of Programs suggested Parents consider enrolling
Student at the Greenwich Alternative High School and offered to arrange for Student and
Parents to visit. (B-l p. 3) A visit was later arranged for Father on J anuary 23, 2015. (B-19
13-2)

The circumstances regarding the procedure administration followed when withdrawing
Student from GHS are not entirely clear. A Student Withdrawal Form was signed by the
GHS Administrator on 1/8/ 15. (B—16 pp. 1—2) The date of withdrawal on the form was
noted as 9/15/2014 and in place of Parent’s Signature there was a note indicating that
Parent never returned the withdrawal papers. (Id.) The listed date of withdrawal is one day
before Father gave notice to GHS of his intent to unilaterally place Student at the Spire
School. (Joint Stipulation) The GHS administrator could only speculate as to why
9/15/2014 was listed by her assistant, but with no other corroborating evidence her
speculation was not credited.

The Spire School is a therapeutic day school serving students who have depression,
anxiety, school avoidance, and various other mental health struggles. (Testimony of Spire
School Life Coach, 12/15/2015) Given that the student body and class size at the Spire
School is far smaller than that at GHS the level of ambient noise is lower at the Spire
School than it is at GHS.

The bell system at the Spire School is lower in volume than at GHS. (Testimony of
District Evaluation Team Special Education Teacher, 12/18/2015)

Per Greenwich School District Coordinator for Guidance and School Counseling, anyone
with training would be qualiﬁed to lead a 504 meeting. (Testimony of Greenwich School
District Coordinator for Guidance and School Counseling, 12/ 15/2015)

While the Greenwich School District Coordinator for Guidance and School Counseling
indicated that the practice in the District was for the Guidance Secretary to send out an
invitation to the meeting with a copy of the procedural safeguards, she could not conﬁrm
that any invitations for 504 meetings were sent out by the Guidance Secretary to the
Parents in the instant matter, nor could she conﬁrm that that procedural safeguards were
sent. (Testimony of Greenwich School District Coordinator for Guidance and School
Counseling, 12/15/2015)

504 procedural safeguards are available on the District’s website. (Testimony of
Greenwich School District Coordinator for Guidance and School Counseling)

At the time of the hearing, the Spire School has recently been approved by the State of
Connecticut as a special education school, but it was not approved at the time Student was
enrolled. (Testimony of Spire School Life Coach, 12/15/2015) The focus of the school
remains therapeutic and is not geared toward children with severe learning disabilities.
(Testimony of Spire School Life Coach, 12/15/2015)

Spire School’s Head Life Coach holds a Master’s Degree in Counseling Psychology and
holds a State of Connecticut certiﬁcation as a school counselor, is a National Certiﬁed
Counselor and is a Licensed Professional Counselor in the State of Connecticut.
(Testimony Spire School Life Coach, 12/15/2015; P-85, p.1)

Student receives counseling from, and her case is managed by, Spire School’s Head Life
Coach, who has Student assigned to her typical caseload of 7 students. (Testimony of Spire
School Life Coach, 12/15/2015) Student has been assigned to the caseload of the Head Life
Coach since enrolling in October of 2014. (1d.)

Instruction at the Spire School is delivered in small classes of 3—5 students, with occasional
one to one instruction as a result of the overall school scheduling for all students.
(Testimony of Spire School Life Coach, 12/15/2015)

Student’s ﬁnal grades for the 2014-2015 school year were in the B range or higher. With
the exception of a 13+ in AP Environmenta1 Science and a Pass in Health, Student received
grades of A— or higher in all of her Spire Schoo1 classes. (P—71) Student received an A in
German but she had to ﬁnish work over the summer to complete the course. (1d,)

Student is presently enrolled in three of Spire School’s advanced college preparatory
classes (Advanced Placement Calculus, Advanced Placement Physics and Advanced
Placement English Literature and Composition) with the remainder of her courses falling
into the school’s standard college preparatory track. (P-82) Student’s grades for the ﬁrst
quarter of the 2015—2016 school year are all A’s with the exception of a Pass grade in Yoga
and a B+ in German 11. (1d.)

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DISCUSSION:

1. Denial of Student’s Renewed Motion for Acoustic Testing at Greenwich High School
On September 25, 2015, Attorney for the Student ﬁled a Motion for Order Permitting Acoustic
Testing at Greenwich High School in which an order was sought allowing an acoustic testing
facility to come onto the high school property and install acoustic measuring devices at various
locations throughout the campus. Similar testing at Student’s unilateral placement Was also to be
arranged. On October 2, 2015, the Board ﬁled an Objection of the Greenwich Board of
Education to [Student’s] Motion for Order Permitting Acoustic Testing at Greenwich High
School. This Motion was denied on October 6, 2015 in a written decision. After the Board ﬁled
their written response to Student’s Due Process Hearing Request on October 9, 2015, Attorney
for the Student ﬁled a Renewed Motion for Order Permitting Acoustic Testing at Greenwich
High School. This motion was denied on November 4, 2015 on the record with an indication
from the Hearing Ofﬁcer that basis for her denial would be included in the ﬁnal decision. While
Attorney for the Student cited no legal authority in support of her initial motion for acoustic
testing, it would appear that a hearing ofﬁcer would be authorized to issue such an order
pursuant to R.C.S.A. §10-76h-15 (h), which provides that a hearing ofﬁcer may require
additional evidence on any relevant matter. Substantively, Student’s request for acoustic testing
was grounded in a concern that a Board witness might testify that Student’s unilateral placement
was not signiﬁcantly quieter than the public high school and that such testimony would be
subjective. In the decision on the initial motion, it was held that if and when such testimony
occurs, Attorney for the Student would be afforded the opportunity to cross examine that Board
witness. As noted by the Board in its objection, a hearing ofﬁcer is also authorized to take
administrative notice of the size of the student body and the classroom student count in each
school and take notice of the fact that the differences in each may result in a louder 0r quieter
environment. R.C.S.A. §10-76h-15(1). 1n denying the initial motion it was held that the
availability of administrative notice and cross-examination were sufﬁcient to address Student’s
substantive concerns. Further, the Hearing Ofﬁcer indicated that pursuant to R.C.S.A. §10—76h—
15 (h), the ruling denying Student’s Motion for Order Permitting Acoustic Testing at Greenwich
High School had no impact on the ability of the Hearing Ofﬁcer to require additional evidence
on acoustics or any other matter during the pendency of the hearing, were she to ﬁnd that to be
necessary. Student renewed her motion for acoustic testing on October 23, 2015, citing the
Board’s statement in its response to Student’s due process hearing request “...that there is no
evidence that the class period bells are at ‘very high decibel’” and claiming that inclusion of this
statement put the obj ective level of noise in controversy. The Board ﬁled an obj ection to the
renewed motion on October 27, 2015. On November 4, 2015, Student’s Renewed Motion for
Order Permitting Acoustic Testing at Greenwich High School was denied on the same basis as
the original motion, speciﬁcally that the availability of cross—examination and administrative
notice of the differences in actual and proposed educational environments were sufﬁcient to

1 9

March 3, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0051

address the concerns raised by Parent. In addition, the Hearing Ofﬁcer found persuasive the
Board’s argument that the exact decibel level of environments at either GHS or Student’s
unilateral placement was not information that either side had at either of Student’s PPT meetings
and so did not inform the decisions which are at the center of the dispute between the parties. If
the Hearing Ofﬁcer had determined a precise decibel level was required for an adjudication of
the issues before her, she retained the authority during the pendency of the hearing to request it.

2. Child Find Violation. Under the IDEA, a request for an initial evaluation to determine
whether a child is a student with a disability may be initiated either by the Parent or the District.
34 CFR §300.301(b). While the legislation and regulations contemplate that a Parent may bring a
child’s potential disability to the attention of a District, the District has an independent,
afﬁrmative and ongoing ob1igation, referred to generally and hereinafter as the “child ﬁnd”
obligation, to identify students with disabilities. 20 USC §§1401 (3); 1412(a)(3); 34 CFR §
300.111; and R.C.S.A. §10-76d-7(e). The District’s child ﬁnd duty is triggered when the local
education agency (“LEA") has reason to suspect a disability, and reason to suspect that special
education sewices may be needed to address that disability. Regional School District No. 9
Board ofEducarion v. Mr. and Mrs. M, as Parents and Next Friends of MM a Minor Child 53
IDELR 8; 109 LRP 51058 (2009) US. District Court, Connecticut; citing New Paltz Central
Sch. Dist. v. St. Pierre, 307 F. Supp. 2d 394, 400 (N.D.N.Y. 2004). It is important to note that
Regional School District No. 9 Board ofEducation v. Mr. and Mrs. M does not set faith a
conjunctive test requiring that the District must have reason to suspect both a disability and
reason to believe Student requires special education before the child ﬁnd obligation to refer is
triggered. Rather, the Court in Regional School District No. 9 Board of Education v. Mr. and
Mrs. M explicitly found that the suspicion of a disability stands alone as the sole factor required
in order to trigger the District’s child ﬁnd ob1igati0n to evaluate a Student, stating “...the issue is
not whether the Board should have known that the Student qua1iﬁed for special education
sewices, but rather whether the Board should have convened a PPT to begin to evaluate that
possibility. (1d,) To answer the latter question in the present case requires an analysis of what
the District knew about Student and when.

Information on Student’s medical condition was reported to school by Parents through
email correspondence beginning in February of 2014 and additional information about Student’s
status was provided by Parents on an ongoing basis through subsequent emails and informal
meetings at school between Mother and GHS staff that occurred when Mother was in the schoo1
volunteering or serving as a substitute teacher. (Findings of Fact 20, 25 and 36) Documentation
of Student’s disability was ﬁrst provided to the District by Student’s pediatric neurologist, Dr.
Fryer, on April 4, 2015, with a revised letter sent by the same physician on April 9, 2014.
(Findings of Fact 32 and 38) At this point the District was on actual notice that Student had a
disab1ing medical condition and that additional absences were anticipated as a result of her
disability. At the time Dr. Fryer’s April 4, 2014 was received, the District had already notiﬁed
the Parents through the attendance policy warning letter that if Student’s absences were to
continue Student was at risk for loss of credit in a11 of her courses. (Finding of Fact 23)

Courts have held that child ﬁnd does not require that schools conduct a formal evaluation
of every struggling student (see J.S, v. Scarsdale Union Free Sch, Dist, 826 F. Supp. 2d 635, 661
(S.D.N.Y. 2011) and also that a school’s failure to diagnose a disability at the earliest possible
moment is not per se actionable, especially in cases where a disability is difﬁcult to diagnose or

20

March 3, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0051

is the subject of controversy among experts (See A.Pr ex rel. Powers v. Woodstock Bd. of Educ,
572 F. Supp. 2d 221, 226 (D. Conn. 2008). In the present case, however, Student was not a child
attending school every day experiencing general academic struggles for reasons yet to be
determined. Student had a speciﬁc, disabling medical condition which according to documents
generated by the District was signiﬁcantly impacting her ability to attend classes and complete
work during the second semester of the 2013—2014 school year. (Findings of Fact 23 and 40)

1t is unclear from the record whether Student was legitimately able to sufﬁciently make
up work to receive passing grades by the end of the 2013—2014 year, or whether, as at least one
teacher testiﬁed, she was given a sympathetic pass on sub-par work. (Finding of Fact 49)
However to ﬁnd that there was a negative impact on Student, the Hearing Ofﬁcer need only look
to the undisputed fact that Student was unable to complete the second half of AP US History in
the 2013—2014 year and had to take an incomplete. (Finding of Fact 44).

Thus, to the extent there was documentation of Student’s limited strength, limited Vitality
and heightened alertness to environmental stimuli from chronic migraines that impacted
Student’s ability to receive direct instruction on a regular basis and complete coursework in a
timely manner, a referral for special education to begin to evaluate whether she needed
interventions was warranted. This was true even if GHS staff at the time believed that Student
did not need specialized instruction or believed that the effect of Student’s absences could be
remediated through 504 accommodations. The existence of evidence that might establish that a
Student does not qualify for special education and related sewices does not relieve the District
from its obligation to evaluate a Student who the District suspects has a disability (Regional
School District No. 9 Board of Education v. Mr. and Mrs. M, as Parents and Next Friends of
MM. a Minor Child) Further, there is no carve out exempting Districts from its child ﬁnd
obligations under child ﬁnd because a Student has Section 504 accommodation plan. 34 CFR
§300.111

Having found that the District should have referred Student for an initial PPT meeting
under child ﬁnd, the next question that must be answered is at what point between February
2014, when Student’s migraines began, and September 26, 2015, when Father gave notice of his
intent to unilaterally place Student would it have been reasonable to expect the District to make
the referral. Courts have inferred a requirement that Districts identify disabled children within a
reasonable time after school staff is on notice of behavior that is likely to indicate a disability
W.B. v. Mafula, 67 F.3d 484, 501 (3d Cir. 1995), abrogated on other grounds by A. W. v. Jersey
Cily Pub. Schs., 486 F.3d 791 (3d Cir. 2007).

Where the onset of a medical condition is sudden and treatment protocols are in a state of
ﬂux with varying levels of success, some delay in a referral may be reasonable. D.K., et a]. v.
Abingmn School District, 696 F.3d 233 (3rd Circuit 2012). Student’s medical condition like that
of the Student in D.K. was newly diagnosed and the causes and triggers were in the process of
being identiﬁed, different treatment protocols were being implemented, and the results of the
treatments were unknown. There was a possibility that Student’s medical condition might have
improved during the four months that remained of the 2013-2014 school year after her diagnosis.
Indeed, her attendance in May and June of 2014 showed improvement. (Finding of Fact 60)

A delay becomes unreasonable when a student is unable to attend school at all for
signiﬁcant stretches of time. It is even more unreasonable when those absences occur during the
critical beginning of the school year. GHS was aware at the beginning of the 2014-2015 school
year that Student’s disability had the potential to make her unavailable for instruction in school

21

March 3, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0051

for entire weeks based on her attendance history the prior year (Finding of Fact 23) When a child
with Student’s medical diagnosis and attendance history fails to attend a single class for the ﬁrst
7 days of school, it is not the time to adjust the level of difﬁculty of courses in the hope that
when Student does show up she will not overwhelmed or adjust accommodations, which can not
be implemented because the Student isn’t physically present to be accommodated, it is time to
refer the Student.

A review of the R.C.S.A. reveals that a prompt referral to a PPT is required of all
children who have been suspended repeatedly or whose behavior, attendance or progress in
school is considered unsatisfactory 01' at a marginal level of acceptance. R.S.C.A. §10—76d-7
Given that as of March 7, 2014, Student was at 01' more than halfway to the number of absences
that would result in a loss of credit with an attendant appeal opportunity and that after this notice
letter was issued Student went on to miss seven full days of instruction in March and another
seven days of instruction in April, it is reasonable to ﬁnd that the Student’s attendance was
unsatisfactory. (Findings of Fact 23 and 60) The response of GHS after the absences continued
and the loss of credit threshold was met in each of these courses was to place the Student on a
special exemption list in April, 2014. (Finding of Fact 45) The Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds that under
the facts of this case a prompt referral to a PPT was required under §10—76d-7 when the
Student’s absences continued in March and April of 2014.

Of note is the holding in Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A,, 557 US. 230 (U.S. 2009), in
which the Supreme Court determined that parents may be entitled to tuition reimbursement even
when their children had never received special education from their LEAs. The Supreme Court
determined that 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(i) created a safe harbor for schools by explicitly
barring reimbursement, but only when the district made a FAPE available by "correctly
identifying a child as having a disability and proposing an IEP adequate to meet the child's
needs." Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. TA, 557 US. 230, 241 (U.S. 2009). As such the Supreme
Court looked not only at whether there was the provision of an appropriate IEP, but to the
identiﬁcation process as well to determine whether FAPE was on the table in a tuition
reimbursement case.

Child ﬁnd Violations have been interpreted by the Courts to be procedural in nature.
“Procedural flaws alone do not automatically require a court to find that a board denied a student
a FAPE. Procedural ﬂaws that result in the loss of an educational opportunity, or that seriously
infringe the parents‘ opportunity to participate in the IEP formulation process, however, ‘cleaxly
result in the denial ofa FAPE.'" A.E., 463 F. Supp. 2d at 216, quoting W.A, v. Pascarella, 153 F.
Supp. 2d 144, 153 (D. Conn. 2001). Relief is warranted only if procedural inadequacies "(1)
impeded the child's right to a [FAPE]; (11) signiﬁcantly impeded the parents' opportunity to
participate in the decision making process regarding the provision of [a FAPE] t0 the parents'
child; or (111) caused a deprivation of educational beneﬁts." 20 U.S.C. § 1415(t)(3)(E)(ii).

MA. et al. v. Torrington Board ofEducaz‘ion, 980 F. Supp. 2d 245, 62 IDELR 28. In order to
establish a procedural Violation of the child ﬁnd obligation, the school ofﬁcials must have
"overlooked clear signs of disability," be "negligent in failing to order testing,“ or have "no
rational justiﬁcation for not deciding to evaluate.“ Bd. of Educ. V. L.M., 478 F.3d 307, 313 (6th
Cir. 2007) A.P. V. Woodstock Bd. of Educ., 572 F. Supp. 2d 221, 225 (D. Conn. 2008). While
arguably the District acknowledged Student’s disability when the Guidance Counselor drafted a
504 accommodation plan, it was clearly negligent in failing to order any evaluations of Student
to determine whether Student needed specialized instinction or related services.

22

March 3, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0051

3. September 29, 2014 Eligibility Determination Was Not Error. While District should have
referred prior to the September 29, 2014, it did not err when it determined the Student was not
e1igib1e for Special Education at the September 29, 2014 PPT meeting. The District convened the
PPT meeting in response to Father’s notice of unilateral placement. Pursuant to 34 CFR
300.301(a), the District was required to conduct a full and initial evaluation, before the initial
provision of special education and related services. (emphasis added). The initial evaluation must
be conducted within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation. 34 CFR §300.301
(c) (1)(i) The evaluation must consist of procedures to determine if the child is a child with a
disability under 300.8 and to determine the educational needs of the child. 34 CFR §300.301 (c)

(3) (i-ii)

4. December 10, 2014 Eligibility Determination Was Error. No evidence was presented at the
hearing that anyone in the District gave any consideration to the possibility that any of the
disability categories under IDEA might apply to Student given her diagnosis, until after Father
gave notice of his intent to unilaterally place Student at Spire School. The information the School
had regarding Student’s diagnosis and absenteeism suppOited an inquiry into the category of
Other Health Impairment. Under the IDEA, Other Health Impairment is deﬁned as having
limited strength, vitality, 0r alertness, including a heightened a1ertness to environmental stimuli,
that results in limited alertness with respect to the educational environment, that: (a) is due to
chronic or acute health problems such as asthma, attention deﬁcit disorder or attention deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorder, diabetes, epilepsy, a heart condition, hemophilia, lead poisoning,
leukemia, nephritis, rheumatic fever, sickle cell anemia, and Tourette syndrome; and (b)
Adversely affects a child's educational performance. 34 C.F.R. §300.8(c)(9)

The list of conditions set forth under the deﬁnition of 0H1 is not exhaustive. Letter to
Sterner, 30 IDELR 266 (1988) If the Student’s condition results in limited strength, vitality 0r
alertness and the Student’s educationai performance is adversely affected then the Student meet
the criteria for the Disability of 0H1. (Id)

Chronic and debilitating migraines have qualiﬁed other students for special education
under the disability categow of 01-11. The analysis conducted by the SRO in Board ofEducation
of the Wappingers F alls Central School District New York, State Educational Agency 39 IDELR
116, 103 LRP 25882 (April 14, 2003) while not binding, is instinctive. 1n Wappingers Falls, a
pediatric neurologist reported to the District that student suffered from migraines which lasted
for several hours to an entire day and that she experienced sensitivity to light, nausea and
weakness. As in the instant case, the student took preventative medication, which was not
always effective, and as a result she ended up in the hospital taking intravenous medication on
more than one occasion. The SRO in Wappingers Falls found that student’s chronic migraines
limited her strength and Vitality and alertness in the educational environment, and as such she
met the ﬁrst criteria of the statutory deﬁnition of 0H1. (1d.) In the present case, the September 9,
2014 letter from Student’s pediatric neurologist documents Student’s diagnosis of chronic
migraine headaches and hospitalization for same. (P—15) Student had a heightened alertness to
stimulation in the environment and noise in particular caused Student’s headaches to worsen.
The SRO in Wappinger F alls went on to ﬁnd that student met the second criteria for 01—11, that
her educational performance must be adversely impacted to the extent he required special
services and programs. (Id) The basis for this ﬁnding was that her migraines and resulting
absenteeism began to interfere with student’s ability to keep up with her coursework. 1d. The

23

March 3, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0051

SRO also noted that student’s section 504 committee had acknowledged in the student’s
accommodation plan that her ability to learn was affected by the headaches, noting that her
absences from school caused a decrease in academic performance. In the present case, Student’s
April 10, 2014 504 accommodation plan noted that “Student was unable to perform any
cognitive functions without difﬁculty.” (P-17) As learning is by deﬁnition a cognitive function,
the April 10, 2014 504 accommodation plan is an acknowledgement by the District that
Student’s ability to learn was negatively impacted by her disability. Student’s failure to complete
the course requirements for AP US History and Student’s inabi1ity to begin the 2014-2015 school
year due to her medical condition conﬁrmed the adverse impact ﬁnding.

Having found that Student meets the criteria for the disability of 0H1 as deﬁned by 20
USC § 1401(3);1401(30); 34 CFR 300.8 § (c)(9), the ﬁnal step in deciding whether or not
Student should have been identiﬁed as a child with a disability under 34 CFR § 300.8 is
determining whether or not the child by reason of her disability needs specia1 education and
related services. 34 CFR §300.8(a)(1) "Special education“ means specially designed instruction,
provided at no cost to the parents, that is intended to meet the unique needs of a chi1d with a
disability, including: 1) instruction conducted in the classroom, in the home, in hospitals and
institutions, and in other settings; and 2) instruction in physical education. 20 USC §1401(29); 34
CFR § 300.39(a)(1) “Specia11y designed instruction means adapting, as appropriate to the needs
of an eligible child, the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction —— (i) to address the
child‘s unique needs resulting from the disability; and (ii) ensuring the child‘s access to the
general curriculum so that the child can meet the educational standards that apply to all children
within the jurisdiction of the public agency. 34 CFR §300.39(b)(3)

The District’ 5 central argument is that Student did not and does not now need specialized
instruction, and thus does not qualify as a child with a disability under the IDEA 20 USC §
1401(3)(a)(i) and (ii); 34 CFR §300.8(a)(1). Student’s academic achievement both in private
elementary school and in her ﬁrst semester at GHS ranged from satisfactory to exemplary.
Neither the private neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. Weeks nor the District’s evaluation
show signiﬁcant deﬁcits in Student’s academic achievement. While Student’s aptitude for the
AP college level coursework was an area of dispute between the AP teachers, who felt Student’s
work was mediocre, and Father, who felt Student was up to the chal1enge, the evidence presented
at hearing indicated that, but for the intervening sudden onset of chronic migraines, Student
would have progressed successfully through the regular education curriculum of GHS.

While Student’ 5 achievement testing indicated that content would likely not need to be
modiﬁed, the delivery and methodology of instruction during Student’s absences would need to
be. While eschewed by Parents at the PPT meetings, homebound tutoring would have been an
option for addressing Student’s educational needs resu1ting from missed instruction. The
deﬁnition of special education includes “instruction conducted...in the home.” 20 USC §1401
(25)(A) 34 CFR §300.39 (a)(1)(i). While the District offered make—up sessions in the learning
center or in meetings with teachers during their regular ofﬁce hours, these offers were in essence
offers of assistance to Student in the event she had difﬁculty teaching herself what she had
missed in the way of direct instruction.(Finding of Fact 90) When a Student misses so much
direct instwction in curriculum content as a result of her disability that she is unable to complete
the course and as a result receives an incomplete, the existing accommodations and
interventions, whether they be general education or 504 are inadequate. The District erred when
it found the Student ineligible on December 10, 2014.

5. Analysis of Unilateral Placement and Tuition Reimbursement. A District must provide all
children with disabilities with a "free appropriate public education.“ 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A).
When a District fails to give a disabled child a FAPE education, the child‘s parent may remove
the child to an appropriate private school and then seek retroactive tuition reimbursement from
the state, but Parents who do so without the consent of school ofﬁcials, do so at their own
ﬁnancial risk, F lorence County School Dist. Four v. Carter By and Through Carter, 510 U.S, 7,
15, 126 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1993). Those parents are entitled to reimbursement only if the public
placement violated IDEA and that the private school placement was proper under the Act. Id.

In the present case, the educational program offered to Student, a modiﬁed schedule with
accommodations, was not appropriate and denied Student a Free Appropriate Public Education
because it failed to provide an adequate means for Student to recoup missed instruction and
failed to provide a plan which would enable Student to attend school in the ﬁrst place.

Reimbursement for the cost of tuition in a unilateral placement is authorized by the IDEA
if the Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds that the District did not make FAPE available to the child in a timely
manner and that the private placement is appropriate. 34 CFR §300.148(c). The unilateral
placement may be found appropriate even if the hearing ofﬁcer ﬁnds that it does not meet the
State standards that apply to education provided by the State Educational Authority. (1d,)

Denial 01' reduction of reimbursement is permissible if one of the following conditions
are met: (l)(i) At the most recent PPT meeting the parents attended prior to the removal of the
child from the public school, the parents did not inform the PPT they were rejecting the
placement proposed by the District to provide FAPE to their child, including stating their
concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a private school at public expense; (ii) or at least
ten business days prior to the removal if the child from the public school the parents did not give
written notice to the district that they were rejecting the placement proposed by the District and
stating their concerns and intent to enroll the child in a private school at public expense. 34 CFR
§300.148(d)(1)(ii). Since Father tendered his notice of unilateral placement, which contained the
requisite information, on September 16, 2014, and the Student’s enrollment contract was not
executed until October 14, 2014, Father’s notice is deemed sufﬁcient and timely and thus not a
limiting factor When considering reimbursement.

Denial or reduction of reimbursement is also permissible if the Parent does not make the
Student available for an evaluation by the District after notice of unilateral placement is given.
34 CFR §300.148(d)(2). Student was made available for the District’s evaluation as evidenced
by the existence of the District’s evaluation and as such there is no basis for limiting
reimbursement on this basis. (Finding of Fact 102) Finally, reduction or limitation on
reimbursement is available if the Parents took unreasonable actions. 4 CFR §300.148(d)(3)
Parents repeatedly reached out to the District during the 2013-2014 school year for input on how
they could assist Student. (Findings of Fact 27 and 55) It was not until Student was so ill that she
couldn’t make it through the front doors of GHS for the ﬁrst weeks of school, that Parents gave
notice of their intent to unilaterally place child. This action was not unreasonable given their
child was not able to receive an education at the time under the existing program. Had the
Student been evaluated and identiﬁed, the evidence suggests that Greenwich Alternative High
School has the components Student needs. However, since that program was only a vague
suggestion and not a proposed placement, the placement analyzed for the purposes of tuition
reimbursement is that of the modiﬁed schedule at GHSi

March 3, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0051

The Spire School is an appropriate program for Student. The therapeutic nature of the
program and the one to one transition instruction has resulted in the Student being able to
transition back into a classroom environment and the small school and class size results in
reduced noise, one of Student’s migraine triggers/exacerbating factors.

6. Dismissal of 504 Claims. On August 5, 2015, the Board ﬁled a motion to dismiss issues 7-
11, in denying the Motion to Dismiss the Hearing Ofﬁcer found “A motion to dismiss tests, inter
alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.” Walson v. Ballon Stoll
Bader and Nadler, RC, 121 Conn. App. 366 (2010). In support of its Motion to Dismiss, the
Board claims that Student, who has been identiﬁed as a child with a disability under Section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”) has administrative remedies available to her under both
Section 504 and through the Ofﬁce of Civil Rights which she has not pursued. The Board asserts
that having not pursued administrative remedies in these alternate forums, Student is barred from
seeking relief in an IDEA due process hearing. The Board also claims that the disputed issues are
being brought in an improper forum. The Board’s claim is grounded in the differences between
the legislative purposes of the IDEA and 504 and distinctions between the substantive and
procedural protections of each statute. While there is no dispute that Section 504 and the IDEA
are sourced in different federal statutes, the Second Circuit has recognized a nexus between the
two, speciﬁcally as it pertains to the type of relief being sought and application of the IDEA’s
exhaustion doctrine. Palera v. Board of Education, 288 F.3d 478 (2d Circuit 2002). “.... [T]he
IDEA’S exhaustion requirement applies equally to relief available under other statutes, such as
the ADA, Section 504, and § 1983, if the relief sought under those statutes would also be
available under the IDEA. Thus, if the IDEA is applicable it forecloses the relief appellants
seek under those statutes.” Id. at Footnote 2. The foreclosure of relief suggests that the
administrative process under the IDEA may in some instances be the only forum in which relief
is available. “The IDEA is intended to remedy precisely the sort of claim made by Palera: that a
school district failed to provide her with appropriate educational services.” In determining
whether the Parents were required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing a lawsuit,
the Court in Polem applied a threshold analysis of whether or not the claims made under the
ADA and the Rehabilitation Act sought “relief that is also available under [the 1DEA].” 20
U.S.C. § 1415(1). 1d. The Second Circuit Court went on to ﬁnd that the reimbursement of
expenses as a remedy is a form of relief contemplated by the IDEA, as are various forms of
equitable relief. ld. It is clear that the relief sought in Student’s Issues 9 and 10 above involves
the reimbursement for past and future expenses and as such is a remedy contemplated under the
IDEA. The IDEA exhaustion doctrine is set forth in 20 U.S.C. 1415(1) which provides: “Nothing
in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available
under the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, [42 U.S.C.A § 12101 et
seq.] title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C.A. § 791 et seq.] or other Federal laws
protecting the rights of children with disabilities except that before the ﬁling of a civil action
under such law seeking relief that is also available under the subchapter, the procedures under
subsection (f) and (g) of this section shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required
had the action been brought under this subchapter.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(1) Complainants seeking
redress must overcome the exhaustion hurdle not only if they wish to ﬁle a suit under the IDEA,
as Parents are seeking to do in the present case in Issues 1-6, “but also... whenever they asseit
claims for relief under the IDEA regardless of the statutory basis of their complaint.” Cave v.

26

March 3, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16—0051

East Meadow Union Free School District, 514 F.3d 240 (2d Circuit 2008). While the Second
Circuit in Polera held that one cannot circumvent the IDEA exhaustion requirement by ﬁling
504 and ADA claims directly in United States District Court, Polera and Cave are silent on
whether a Parent must exhaust administrative remedies offered under a different statute prior to
or in lieu of pursuing such claims in an IDEA due process hearing. In the present case where the
remedy of reimbursement sought for the claimed Violation is available under the IDEA, Polera
and Cave provide a sufﬁcient basis to overcome the Board‘s Motion to Dismiss on the basis of
lack of jurisdiction. 1n the absence of authority requiring what would be in effect, the pre-
exhaustion exhaustion requirement proposed by the Board, this Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds that Polem
and Cave provide that claims for which a remedy is available under the IDEA may be
considered, but does not accept the position of the Student that consideration and adjudication is
mandated for reasons set forth below and acknowledges that claims seeking relief not available
under the IDEA would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. While the Board cites Circular
Letter: C-l3, Series 2008-09 Reissue in suppoit of its claim that the Hearing Ofﬁcer lacks
jurisdiction, that same Letter also provides that a Hearing Ofﬁcer may address Section 504
claims, “...only as necessary to resolve the claims under the IDEA.” Circular Letter C-l3, Mark
McQuillan, Series 2008-2009 Reissue (May 20, 2009). Therefore, at a minimum a Hearing
Ofﬁcer has the jurisdiction to engage in an analysis of whether the resolution of any non—IDEA
issues is necessary in order to decide any of the IDEA issues presented in a given case. Whether
or not the relief sought in Issues 10 and 11 above should be granted will depend an analysis and
adjudication of Issues 7, 8, and 9. An analysis and adjudication of Issues 7, 8 and 9 may be
required in order to resolve the IDEA claims set forth in claims 1—6, as all issues are based in a
claims that the Student was denied a Free Appropriate Public Education. At the time the motion
to dismiss was ﬁled, the Hearing Ofﬁcer found that given that a colorable claim has been made
that the relief being sought for the claimed Violations would be available under the IDEA,
dismissal of Student’s claims before the hearing was premature. This brings us to the
consideration of whether, after hearing the evidence, it was necessary to decide any of the 504
issues in order to decide the IDEA issues. Having found that there was a violation of child ﬁnd
and a denial of FAPE, entitling Student to relief under the IDEA, analysis of the Section 504
issues presented in Parent’s request for a due process hearing was not required. Student may
pursue such claims through the dispute resolution procedures offered under Section 504 and if
aggrieved by any portion of this decision will have exhausted her administrative remedies. Thus,
issues 7—11 are dismissed.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

1. The District violated its child-ﬁnd duty under the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act (“IDEA”) and Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies §10-76d-7(c) by failing to
refer Student for Special Education in the Spring of 2014 and as a result of the failure of
the District to refer Student for special education Student was denied a FAPE.

2. The District did not err when it found Student was not eligible for Special Education at
the Flaming and Placement Team (“PPT”) meeting held on September 29, 2014, but
instead planned an evaluation of Student to be reviewed by the PPT at a second PPT
meeting.
