FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Was the program provided by the Board for the 2015~2016 school year appropriate and did it provide
the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment
(LRE)? If not;

2. Does the program at DeverauX-Glenholme School in Washington, CT, including an extended school
year program (ESY), provide the Student with F APE in the LRE?

3. Did the Board commit a procedural Violation by conditioning the receipt of educational services on
the Student attending the district’s school?

4. Is the Student entitled to compensatory education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive F APE as deﬁned in the Individuals
With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et
seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rej ected the program offered by the
Board for the 2015-2016 school year and requested that the Student remain at Deveraux-Glenholme School
for the 2015-2016 school year. The Board denied the Parents’ request; the Parents ﬁled for due process.

On June 26, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. An impartial hearing
ofﬁcer was appointed on J une 26, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was held on July 15, 2015.

A hearing date of December 1, 2015 was chosen by the parties. In an electronic transmission, the Parents’
attorney requested cancellation of the December 1, 2015 hearing date; the parties had resolved the matter,
but needed additional time to ﬁnalize an agreement. In an electronic transmission dated January 15, 2016,
the Parents’ attorney withdrew the matter. The Board was in agreement. The date for mailing the Final
Decision and Order was extended in order to accommodate mediation and the hearing date. The mailing date
for the Final Decision and Order is January 20, 2016.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED.

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing officer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
