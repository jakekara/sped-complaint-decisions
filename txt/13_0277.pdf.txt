FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

Does the Individual Education Program (“IEP”) dated October 5, 2012 provide a F rec
and Appropriate Public Education (“FAPE”) t0 the Student?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The complaint was filed on January 7, 2013 by the Parent. A Pre—hearing Conference
was held on January 18, 2013, where the issue stated above was agreed upon by the
Parties for presentation at a due process hearing. On January 18, 2013, Attorney Manzi
requested a thirty (30) day extension to the resolution period for the purpose of allowing
the Panties to participate in mediation and possibly reso1ve the issue. As there was no
detrimental effect to the Student if the resolution period was extended, and with no
objection from the Board, the resolution period was extended until March 9, 2013. The
date for the Final Decision and Order was set for April 23, 2013. Due Process hearing
dates were set for March 12 and 13, 2013. Mediation was held on February 20, 2013.

On February 26, 2013, Attorney Manzi, through email, withdrew the complaint and
request for a Due Process hearing on behalf of the Parents.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

With the Parent’s withdrawal of the request for a Due Process hearing, and with no
further issues to be resolved, this matter is dismissed with prejudice.
