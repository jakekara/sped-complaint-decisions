Procedural History:

This matter is before the Hearing Ofﬁcer pursuant to a Request for Due Process hearing,
ﬁled by the Parent and received by the Board on October 16, 2012, and identiﬁed as Case No. 13-
0176. A prehearing conference was held on November 6, 2012.

The issues for the due process hearing were identiﬁed at that time and are listed below. The Parties
indicated that a resolution meeting would be held on November 7, 20121 The resolution meeting
was held and was not successful and the Parties agreed to attempt mediation to resolve the issues
The ﬁrst Due Process Hearing date was scheduled for December 12, 2012.

January 22, 2013 Final Decision and Order: 130176

On November 14, 2012 the Parties requested a thirty day extension to allow for mediation and to
postpone the December 12, 2012 Due Process Hearing date, The request was granted, with the
date for the ﬁnal decision and order extended to January 28, 2013. Mediation was held on
December 12, 2012, with the Due Process Heating being postponed until January 9‘ 2013.

On December 27, 2012 counsel for the Board indicated via email that mediation had been
successful and that an “agreement in principle” had been reached, a request to postpone the January
9, 2013 Due Process Hearing until January 1 l, 2013 was also requested. The request was granted.

On January 10, 2013 the Parent requested to postpone the Due Process Hearing as no formal
agreement had been reached, the Hearing Ofﬁcer was also notiﬁed by the reporting agency that
illness was making it difﬁcult to provide staff for that date and a continuance was requested. The
hearing date was postponed until January 17, 2013 to accommodate the Parties.

On January 16, 2013, at 12:53pm, the Parent requested via email to “cancel the hearing tomorrow
with prejudice”. Shortly thereafter Counsel for the Board attempted to clarify that the Parties had a
formalized agreement and that they believed the Parent wanted to “withdraw the complaint with
prejudice” and requested if the hearing date would be held Given the short amount ol‘time that
notice was provided and the somewhat confusing message by the Parent, the Hearing Ofﬁcer
notiﬁed the Patties that the hearing would continue as scheduled in less than 24 hours.

On January 17, 2013 the Hearing was opened and the Parent stated on the record that the Parties had
reached an agreement and that the Parent requested to withdraw the complaint with prejudice. The
Board had no objection to the request to withdraw. The matter was then dismissed with prejudice
and the Hearing was closed.

7611 and related regulations. 20 United States Code §l415(t) and related regulations and in
