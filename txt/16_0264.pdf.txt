FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Was the program provided by the Board from November 25, 2013 to the end of the 2013-2014
school year appropriate and did it provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education
(FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE)?

2. Was the program provided by the Board for the 2014-2015 school year appropriate and did it
provide the Student with FAPE in the LRE?

3. Was the program provided by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year appropriate and does it
provide the Student with FAPE in the LRE?

4. Does the unilateral placement of the Student at St. Catherine’s School for the 2015-2016 school year
provide the Student with a meaningful education?

5. Should the Board be responsible for the cost of the placement and transportation of the Student to
St. Catherine’s School for the 2015—2016 school year?

6. Is the Student entitled to compensatory education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student is classiﬁed with Intellectual Disability and is entitled to F APE as deﬁned in the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a
et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents disagreed with the program the
Board offered for the 2015-2016 school year and requested reimbursement for their unilatera1 placement
at St. Catherine’s School; the Board denied the request. Notice of due process was received by the Board
on November 25, 2015. An impaitial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on December 2, 2015 and a pre—
hearing conference was held on December 4, 2015. In an e1ectronie transmission, the parties informed the
hearing ofﬁcer that the matter had been resolved but requested cancelation of the hearing dates and
additional time to ﬁnalize the agreement; the heating dates were cancelled. In an electronic transmission,
the palties informed the hearing ofﬁcer that the agreement had been signed and withdrew the matter with
prejudice. The mailing date was extended to June 6, 2016 to accommodate the hearing dates.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
