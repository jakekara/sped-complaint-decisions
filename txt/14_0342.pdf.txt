FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Was the program offered by the Board for the 2012-2013 school year appropriate and did it
provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE)?

2. Is the program offered by the Board for the 2013-2014 school year appropriate and does it
provide the Student with FAPE in the LRE? If not?

3. Does the Student require an out of district therapeutic program in order to receive FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as Learning Disabled and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the
Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut
General Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the
program offered by the Board for the 2013—2014 school year. The Parents requested an out of district
therapeutic program. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On J anuary 13, 2014, the Board received notice of the Parents request for due process. The parties agreed to
go to mediation in place of a resolution meeting. The mediation was held on February 10, 2014. An
impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on January 15, 2014 and a pre—hearing conference was held on
Januaty 17, 2014. A hearing date of February 25, 2014 was chosen by the parties. In an electronic
transmission, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the matter had been settled and requested
that it be withdrawn with prejudice. The withdrawal was granted. The date for the mailing of the Final
Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the parties’ mediation and the hearing dates. The date for
mailing the Final Decision and Order is March 28, 2014.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
findings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
