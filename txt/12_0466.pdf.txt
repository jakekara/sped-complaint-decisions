FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

1. Whether the Individualized Education Program offered by the Board for the 2012-2013 academic year is

Education in the Least Restrictive Environment? -
2. If the program offered by the Board is not appropriate, what is the appropriate program?

3. Whether or not the Prior Written Notice section of Student’s Individualized Education Program, dated April
2, 2012, contained inaccuracies?

4. If the Prior Written Notice section of Student’s Individualized Education Program dated April 2, 2012,
contained inaccuracies, did this result in a Violation of Student’s Procedural Safeguards, and, if there was a
violation of Student’s Procedural Safeguards, was Student denied a Free Appropriate Public Education as a

result?
