The complaint was ﬁled by the Board on July 29, 2013 in defense of the Board decision to deny the
Parent a publicly funded IEE. Because the complaint was ﬁled by the Board, there was no requirement
for a resolution meeting by the Panties. The Palties chose not to panicipate in mediation. The original
due process hearings were set for September 23, 2013 and September 26, 2013, with a ﬁnal decision and
order date set for October 11, 2013. On September 11, 2013 the Parties requested a postponement of the
due process hearings until October 10, 2013 as the Palties were engaging in substantive negotiations and
believed that resolution was possible. The due process hearing date was re-scheduled to October 10,
2013, with a new ﬁnal decision and order date set for November 11, 2013. On Friday, October 4, 2013,
the Board notiﬁed the Hearing Ofﬁcer that a settlement agreement was being f01warded to the Parent for
review and signature and that notiﬁcation of a withdrawal would occur as soon as all patties had signed
the agreement. On October 7, 2013, at the close of business, the Hearing Ofﬁcer received notice that all
parties had signed the agreement and that the Board was withdrawing the complaint.

F INAL DECISION AND ORDER:

With the withdrawal of the complaint by the Board, and no further issues to be decided, this matter is
DISMISSED with prejudice.
