 Appearing on behalf of the Hartland Board of Education: Atty. William R. Connon, 
Sullivan, Schoen & Connon, LLC, 646 Prospect Avenue, Hartford, CT  06105-4286    Appearing before: Attorney Patricia M. Strong, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
 The Parent (Mother) filed a due process hearing request with the State 
Department of Education (SDE) on June 27, 2007.  She did not send a copy to the Board.  
This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on June 29.  On July 6, Atty. Connon filed an appearance for the Board.  A prehearing conference was held on July 13.  At the prehearing conference the Parent agreed to send a copy of the complaint to the Board&#8482;s 
attorney.  The Board&#8482;s attorney stated that 
he wanted to file a Motion to Dismiss.  A 
hearing date was agreed on for August 21, 2007, if needed.  The decision deadline was not set since the Parent had not sent the Board a copy of the complaint, as required by 
IDEA Section 1415(b)(7)(A).  The Board's mo
tion was due on July 20.  The Parent&#8482;s reply was due on July 27.  The Board file
d its Motion to Dismiss the due process 
complaint by mailing it to the Hearing Officer 
and Parent on July 20.  This was a timely 
means of complying with the order to file 
the motion by July 20.  The Parent&#8482;s objection on July 23 captioned &#64257;Motion to Dismiss&#64258; the 
Board&#8482;s motion as late is overruled.  The 
Board&#8482;s Motion to Dismiss is pr
operly before me.  The Pare
nt objected because she did not receive it on the due date, but nevertheless, filed her response via fax on July 27.   DISCUSSION OF MO
TION TO DISMISS  The issue raised by the Board is whether th
e Parent is precluded from filing a due 
process complaint because she has an appeal
 pending from a prior 
hearing regarding the 2005-06 and 2006-07 school years.  The Board claims that the stay put provision of 
IDEA requires the Student to maintain hi
s &#64257;current educational placement&#64258; while the 
appeal is pending.  20 U.S.C. Section 1415(j).  In the case on appeal, Hearing Officer
