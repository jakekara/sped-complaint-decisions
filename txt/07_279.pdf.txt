 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 By letter from Mr. Cohn dated September 4, 2007 (the &#64257;Request&#64258;) to the Connecticut Department of Education 
due process unit (&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;), the Parents requested a due process hearing on behalf of the Student.  The Parents are seeking an out-of-district placement at Coltsville for the 
2007/2008 school year with transportation at 
Board expense, and compensatory education 
and reimbursement for &#64257;educational service 
expenses&#64258; for the 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 school 
years due to an &#64257;inappropriate free public education&#64258; provided the Student over those school years.  The Request does not 

identify the date of the IEP team meeti
ng at which these issues were raised.    The undersigned was appointed to this matter by the CTDOE by notice dated 
September 7, 2007.  No sufficiency challeng
e was filed.  The Board on September 20, 
2007 submitted an answer dated September 19, 2007.  The date for mailing the final 
decision and order would, in due course, have been November 16, 2007. 
 By agreement of the parties, a reso
lution meeting convened on September 21, 
2007.  On September 24, 2007, counsel for the Pa
rents reported that at the resolution meeting the parties reached an agreement resolving this matter and that the Parents were 

withdrawing this matter with prejudi
ce in light of that agreement. 
 Accordingly, this matter is hereby DISMISSED.
