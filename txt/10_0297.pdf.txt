Student v. Region 6 Board of Education 
Appearing on behalf of the Parent: Pro Se Appearing on behalf of the Board: Ms. Mary Jo Terranova 
Interim Director of Special Education 
      Regional School District 6 
98 Wamogo Road  
Litchfield, CT 06759 Appearing before:    Attorney 
Janis C. Jerman, Hearing Officer 
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
A special education hearing in the above-cap
tioned matter was requested by Student email 
dated January 24, 2010. The request for due process hearing was received by the Due Process Unit on 
that date. There is no evidence as to when it was received by the Board of Education. Assuming that 
it was received by the Board of Education on the same date, the 30-day resolution period runs 
through February 23, 2010 and the deadline for mailing the final decision and order is April 9, 2010. 
Prior to the scheduling of a pre-hearing conference, via e-mail da
ted January 26, 2010, the Student requested that the request for due process be withdrawn without prejudice. The issues in this case were whether the Board of Education honored a March 2008 mediation 
agreement and whether the Board of Education failed 
to schedule a PPT that the Student could attend. 
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
In light of the above facts, the above-captioned case is hereby dismi
ssed without prejudice.
