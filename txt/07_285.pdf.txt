 This Final Decision and Order was initially
 issued on October 22, 2007.  This case is related to CTDOE Case 07-323, which was comm
enced in light of this Final Decision 
and Order.  This Hearing Officer is assigned to both cases.   In light of certain evidence 
presented in Case 07-323, the Hearing Officer has determined that to protect the privacy 
interests of the Student, it is necessary to mask in the Fi
nal Decision and Order in both this Case and Case 07-323 the identity of, among other i
ndividuals and entities, the District and Board at issue, the names of Di
strict and Board employees, and the name of 
the private school placement at issue.   Acco
rdingly, the Hearing Officer has re-issued the October 22, 2007 Final Decision and Order in Case 07-285.  This re-issued decision 
replaces the names of those i
ndividuals and entities as referenced in the October 22, 2007 issuance with a new designation that will be used in both decisions.  The changes, which 
appear in bold face type 
in this re-issued decision, are not substantive.  
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  SUMMARY  The Student turned age 18 years old in May 2007.  This proceeding was commenced in September 2007 by Mr. and Mrs.

under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1400 et seq. (the &#64257;IDEA&#64258;), as amended effective July 1, 
2005 by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (the &#64257;IDE
IA&#64258;), and its implementing regulations, 34 
                                                 1 The 
reference to &#64257;Student&#64258; in the
 caption used in this Final Decision and Order reflects the 
way this matter is identified in the CT Department of
 Education&#8482;s (the &#64257;Department&#8482;s&#64258;) records and is not 
intended to reflect any determination on the merits of the Board&#8482;s October 10, 2007 motion to dismiss 
(&#64257;Board&#8482;s Motion&#64258;).
