FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has not been identiﬁed as entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education
(F APE) as deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20
U.S.C. §1401 et seq and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq.

At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the ﬁnding that the
Student was not eligible to receive special education and related sewices and requested an
Independent Educational Evaluation. The Board denied the Parents’ request. The Board ﬁled for
due process.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on June 15, 2015 and a pre—hearing conference was
scheduled for June, 26, 2105.

On June 18, 2015, the Mother sent notice that she was withdrawing her request for an
Independent Educational Evaluation without prejudice. On June 19, 2015, the Board, based on

the Mother’s withdrawal, withdrew their request for due process without prejudice.

The mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is July 30, 2015.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
