FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

Does the Student have the correct number of credits required by the Torrington Board
of Education to graduate?

Is the Board denying the Student a free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”)
by graduating the Student at the end of the 2011—2012 academic year?

Does the May 1, 2012 IEP deny the Student a FAPE by failing to provide effective
behavioral supports; modiﬁcations; appropriate accommodations; necessary related
services, supplemental aids and services?

Does the total number of in and out of school suspensions received by the Student
during the 2011—2012 academic years constitute an improper change in placement and
thus a denial of a FAPE?

Has the Student been denied a FAPE by the Board’s failure to provide instruction in
an IAES, despite the ﬁndings of two Manifestation Determination hearings held on
December 16, 201 1 and March 19, 2012?

Has the Student been denied a FAPE by the failure of the Board to reasonably
schedule and provide an approved Independent Educational Evaluation?

Has the Board failed to provide a FAPE t0 the Student by failing to provide the Parent
with a full and complete academic record when so requested?

September 24, 2012 Final Decision and Order: 12—0451

Procedural History:

This matter is before the Hearing Ofﬁcer pursuant to a Request for Due Process Hearing
ﬁled by the Student on May 28, 2012, and received by the Board on the same date. The original
complaint was ﬁled as an expedited complaint. A pre-hearing conference was held on June 6,
2012 in which the Parent requested to amend the complaint and remove it from the expedited
list. The Board had no objection to the Parent ﬁling an Amended Complaint. The issue of
representation of the Student was also raised, as the Student is 18 years of age. The Parent and
the Board both agreed that an Authorization for Educational Advocacy needed to be ﬁled with
the Board. The Parent ﬁled an Amended Complaint on June 19, 2012. The Student in this
matter also ﬁled a notarized Authorization for Educational Advocacy, granting her Parent’s
permission to represent her interests in this matter. The parties stated that they were willing to
attempt mediation to resolve the issues. An initial hearing date of July 16, 2012 was set. On
June 29, 2012, Attorney Laubin requested that the July 16 date be used for mediation and that a
future date be selected for the hearing date. There were also complications noted regarding prior
emails from the Parent that suggested legal counsel was being sought and to whom
communications should be directed.

On July 9, 2012, Attorney Andrew Feinstein ﬁled an appearance in the matter on behalf
of the Student. An extension of the mailing date was granted to allow the parties to utilize the
July 16 date for mediation. August 6, 2012 was set for the new hearing date. On July 30, 2012
Attorney Laubin requested a further extension of the mailing date as the patties believed that
they were nearing agreement and would be working on the formalization of the agreement with
both parties stating that there was no detriment to the Student in granting a continuance.
Attorney Laubin also requested an extension due to medical issues that would preclude her from
attending the hearing date. The parties were to contact the Hearing Ofﬁcer when the formal
agreement was ﬁnalized. On August 17, 2012 Attorney Feinstein requested an extension of the
mailing date to September 30, 2012 as the parties were continuing to work on an agreement
certifying that there was no detriment to the Student should an extension be granted. The Board
had no objection to the extension, which was subsequently granted. On August 29, 2012 in
response to the Hearing Ofﬁcer’s request for a status, Attorney Laubin indicated that it appeared
that settlement talks had ended without a resolution and that hearing dates would be needed.

On September 13, 2012, Attorney Feinstein indicated Via email that he no longer
represented the Student. On September 18, 2012 the Hearing Ofﬁcer requested direction from
the Parent as to the status of the complaint, representation of the Student, and ﬁxture actions to be
taken. On September 18, 2012, the Parent indicated via email that the complaint was being
withdrawn without prejudice.

Final Decision and Order:
It is therefore ordered that:
Pursuant to the request by the Parent to withdraw the request for due process,

any pending motions not yet resolved are dismissed as moot and this matter is
dismissed without prejudice,
