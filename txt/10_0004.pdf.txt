een previously identified with Autism and is entitled to

as defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education 
Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut Genera
l Statute &#167;10-76a. At a PPT meeting the Parents rejected

year and requested placement of the Student at the 

Foundation School. The Board denied the Parent&#8482;s 
request and the Parents filed for due process.
