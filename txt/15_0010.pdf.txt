SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as Deaf and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals
With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General
Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents were in
disagreement with the program provided by the Board for the 2014—2015 school year. The Parents
requested placement at American School for the Deaf. The Board refused the Parents’ request and the
Parents ﬁled for due process.

On July 7, 2014, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. On July 17, 2014 the
Parents’ attorney amended the due process complaint. The amendment changed the timeline for this
matter. The parties agreed to go to a resolution meeting.
