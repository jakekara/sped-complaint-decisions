FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Is the psychiatric evaluation performed by the Board appropriate? If not;
2. Are the Parents entitled to an independent psychiatric evaluation at the public expense?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has not been identiﬁed as entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education as deﬁned in
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut

General Statute §10-76a et seq

At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the psychiatric evaluation presented by
the Board. The Parents requested an independent educational evaluation (IEE). The Board refused the Parents’

request.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on October 31, 2012 and a pre-hearing conference was held on
November 12, 2012. Hearing dates of December 6, December 10 and December 13, 2012 were chosen by the

parties.

In an electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that they were withdrawing their
request for an IEE. The Board, based on the Parents’ notice, withdrew their request for due process without
prejudice. The withdrawal without prejudice was granted.

The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order is December 14, 2012..

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
