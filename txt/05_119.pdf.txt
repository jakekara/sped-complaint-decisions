June 3, 2005 -1- Final Decision and Order 05-119   STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION    Student v. Greenwich Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parents: Mother, pro se  
 Appearing on behalf of the Board:  Attorney Susan C. Freedman 
Shipman & Goodwin LLP 
One Constitution Plaza Hartford, CT  06103-1919  Appearing before:    Attorney Patricia M. Strong, Hearing Officer 
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   PROCEDURAL HISTORY    The Mother filed a hearing request on May 20, 2005.  This Hearing Officer was 
assigned to the case on that date.  On May 24 Atty. Freedman filed an appearance and 
moved to dismiss the hearing as premature.  According to her letter, the Student had not 
yet been identified as eligible for special education and a planning and placement team 
meeting was scheduled for June 2, 2005.  A prehearing conference was scheduled on 
May 25.  The Mother was available by telephone at the scheduled time.  The Board's 

attorney could not be reached on her cellular telephone at that time.  The Mother advised 
the Hearing Officer that she was not aware that she had requested a due process hearing and that she had simply filled out a stack of papers sent to her by the Board.  She did not 
want to go forward with a hearing.  She was asked to send a letter to that effect.  The Board's attorney was later advised of that conversation.  No communication has been 

received from the Mother regarding her intention to pursue the hearing.  
   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  It is ordered that this case is dismissed without prejudice.
