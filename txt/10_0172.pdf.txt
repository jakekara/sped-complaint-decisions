FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
ISSUE: 1. Should the Board be required to provide an independent educational evaluation of the Student at public expense? PROCEDURAL HISTORY: 
The Board&#8482;s Director of Pupil Personnel Services requested this hearing by mailing a form to 
the State Department of Educati

conference that the Parent 
would present her case on the first hearing date.  On January 6, 2010, the Parent&#8482;s attorney objected to presenting the Parent&#8482;s case first and, if required to
