  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:    1. Whether the Board is providing the Student FAPE in accordance with the 
IDEA; if not  2. Whether the Student should be placed at the American School for the Deaf 
with vocational support.   SUMMARY/PROCEDURAL HISTORY  On December 2, 2003, the State of Connecticut Department of Education received a 
request for hearing from the Parent, forwarde
d by the Montville Board of Education.  On December 2, 2003, the undersigned was appointed as hearing officer to preside over the 

hearing, rule on all motions, determine findings of fact and conclusions of law, and issue 
an order.    A prehearing conference was scheduled for December 12, 2003.  During the prehearing 
conference, the Parent, the Student, and Attorney Meuser, on behalf of the Board, appeared.  Discussions during the prehearing conference revealed the Student in the above-referenced matter was 18 years of age.  Although the Student has reached the age 
of majority, the Parent, and not the Student, filed the request for hearing. 
 So as to not stall the proceedings, the Hearing Officer was prepared to make exception 
and allow the Student to supplement the Parent&#8482;s original hearing request by submitting 
his own signed written request for a hearing for the record.
