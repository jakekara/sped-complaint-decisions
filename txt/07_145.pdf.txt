 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 
ISSUES:  Whether the child&#8482;s 2007-2008 Individualized Education Program (IEP) provides 
the child with a free and appropriate public education?  
 
PROCEDURE:  The hearing convened on fifteen days; the dates of hearing were selected to accommodate the scheduling needs of both partie
s. The parties agreed to extend the date 
for final decision and adjourned to allow time to conduct a psychological re-evaluation. After consulting with the evaluator, the parents withdrew their consent to use physical restraints, as a behavior intervention, for the child.  The local education agency filed a request for stay-put to reinstate the use of physical restraints; the request was denied. The out-of-district placement determined th
ey could no longer provide a program to the 
child. The child&#8482;s IEP was modified to refl
ect the change in placement. The local 
education agency and parents agreed to sear
ch for a placement for the child. The local 
education agency again made a request for st
ay-put and an Interim Order to reflect the 

child&#8482;s change in placement.  
The parties agreed to file final briefs in the form of final 

statements and arguments. The record closed on June 12, 2008. 

 SUMMARY:   
The parents claim the individualized educati
on program (IEP) is inappropriate because 
the child must attend programs in three sepa
rate locations; and be transported two hours/ day. The IEP also does not provide for consis
tency in managing the child&#8482;s behavior in 
all environments.
