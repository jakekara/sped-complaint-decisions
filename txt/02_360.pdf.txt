January 29, 2003 -1- Final Decision and Order 02-360     STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION   Student v. East Lyme Board of Education      Appearing for the Student:   Attorney James C. Wing, Jr.        51 Gillette Street       Hartford, CT 06105-2636  Appearing for the Board:   Attorney Frederick Dorsey       Siegel, O&#8482;Connor, Zangari.         O&#8482;Donnell & Beck, P.C.       150 Trumbull Street       Hartford, CT  06103  Appearing Before:    Scott P. Myers, Hearing Officer           FINAL DECISION AND ORDER (Eligibility and Manifestation Determination)   ISSUES:  1. In addition to being eligible to receive special education and related services on the basis of OHI-ADD/ADHD and OHI-Depression, is the Student eligible to receive special education and related services on the basis of an SED designation?1 2. Was the possession of Prozac by the Student at school on November 7, 2002 a manifestation of the Student&#8482;s disability(ies)? 3. Was the possession of Tylenol with Codeine by the Student at school at any time between November 1 and November 7, 2002 a manifestation of the Student&#8482;s disability(ies)?2                                                   1 Issue # 1 as framed in the January 13, 2003 Second Pre-Hearing Conference Report and Order assumed that the Student had not been identified as eligible at the January 8, 2003 PPT based on OHI-Depression.  The parties subsequently stipulated to that designation as well as OHI-ADD/ADHD.  Accordingly, what remained for hearing was a disagreement as to an SED designation.    2 Issue # 3 as framed in the January 13, 2003 Second Pre-Hearing Conference Report and Order assumed that the Student was not in possession of Tylenol with Codeine at school other than on November 7, 2002.  Based on the Student&#8482;s testimony, it is likely that she was also in possession of Tylenol with Codeine at school on November 6, 2002.  To moot the issue permanently, Issue # 3 is restated to include the period November 1 through November 7, 2002.
