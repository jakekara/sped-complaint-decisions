Hearing Ofﬁcer

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Whether the Board offered the Student an appropriate program for the 2012-13 school
year which provides FAPE in the least restrictive environment.

2. If not, whether the Parents’ unilateral placement of the Student at Dublin School for the
2012—13 school year, with related sewices, is appropriate and shall be reimbursed.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:

This request for hearing was received by the Board on September 20, 2012 and a prehearing
conference convened on September 27, 2012. At the pl'ehearing conference, counsel repoﬁed
that they had agreed to mediate the case on October 18, 2012.

On Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 6:30 pm, the Parents’ attorney submitted a request for
postponement of the hearing scheduled for Monday, November 5 “[g]iven the storm and its
aftermath” and as the parties are “in the process of ﬁnalizing a mutually agreeable settlement
agreement.” The Parents’ attorney re-sent this request on Sunday, November 4, 2012 and also
sent a text to the hearing ofﬁcer, without copying the Board’s attorney, also following up on this
request. The Parents’ attorney failed to provide any factual reason why this request was not
submitted in a timely fashion ﬁve business days prior to the scheduled hearing date or why the
hearing should be rescheduled and therefore, this request was denied. While the
I-Iurricane/Tropical Storm Sandy had caused damage to areas in the state on October 29—30,
2012, by the scheduled hearing date the Board schools and Board ofﬁces were operating on a
regular schedule.

November 5, 2012 Final Decision and Order 13-0145

The hearing convened on November 5, 2012. At the hearing the Board’s attorney was present,
but the Parents’ attorney was not present. The Parents’ attorney conveyed to the Board’s
attorney that he was objecting to the dismissal of this case, but he was driving to some other
matter or ofﬁce and was not en route to the scheduled hearing. The Parents’ attorney also
conveyed to the Board’s attorney that he was having difﬁculty contacting the Parents, but the
Parents’ attorney never informed the hearing ofﬁcer of this difﬁculty, 1101‘ did he appear at the
hearing to provide this information, 01‘ provide any other factual reason why the Parents and the
Parents’ attorney could not attend the scheduled hearing date.

As the Parents and the Parents’ attorney failed to appear at the scheduled hearing date, the matter
is dismissed.
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The matter is DISMISSED.
