PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:

This hearing request was received by the Board on August 1, 2013, and a preheating conference
convened on August 8, 2013. At the preheating conference, it was conﬁrmed that the mailing date of
the decision was October 15, 2013, and the initial hearing date of September 17, 2013 was scheduled.
Al the preheating conference both parties indicated that they agreed to mediate this case.

On August 29, 2013 the Surrogate Parent submitted a Request/Motion t0 Compel Mediation 0r
Resolution Session. That Motion was granted, in part. The I’Iearing Officer does not have authority to
compel attendance at a resolution session, which was not convened in a timely manner and cannot
compel cooperation in the voluntary mediation process. It was found, however, that the Board failed to
convene a resolution meeting within 15 days ofi'eceipt 0f the due process hearing request.

The regulations provide that “[i]1‘the LEA fails to hold the resolution meeting speciﬁed in paragraph (a)
of this section within 15 days of receiving notice of a parent’s due process comp1aint or fails to
participate in the resolution meeting, the parent may seek the intewention of a hearing ofﬁcer to begin
the due process hearing timeline. 34 CFR 300.510(b)(5). Therefore, the mailing date 01‘ the decision was
revised to reﬂect that the due process hearing timeline began on August 29, 2013. Therefore, the new
mailing date ot‘the decision was set as Friday, October 1 1, 2013,
