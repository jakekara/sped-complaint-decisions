 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  A special education hearing in the above-captioned matter was requested by the Student via 
letter dated June 3, 2009. It was received by the Board of Education on June 4, 2009. The 30-day 
resolution period ran through July 4, 2009.  The orig
inal deadline for mailing the final decision and 
order was August 18, 2009. 
A pre-hearing conference was held on July 2, 2009. Attorney Marisa Mascolo appeared on behalf of the Student and Attorney Michelle Laubin appeared on behalf of the Board of Education. The issues were identified as follows: 
1. Whether the IEP prepared for Student for the 2009-10 school year is appropriate; 2. Whether the Parents&#8482; unilateral placement at
 the Rectory School is appropriate and should be paid for by the Board; 3. Whether the Board should have provided homeb
ound tutoring for Student from the time 
of the May 19, 2009 PPT through the end of the 2008-09 school year and if so, what shall be the remedy for its failure to do so. 
Attorney Mascolo filed a request for a 30-day extension of the mailing date. The request was 
granted after full consideration of the positions of the parties and the deadline for mailing the final 

decision and order was extended until September 
17, 2009. Hearing dates were scheduled for August 12 and 18, 2009.
