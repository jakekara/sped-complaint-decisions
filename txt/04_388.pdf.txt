Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES  I. Whether the child remains eligible for specialized instruction, should he 
continue to be identified as a child with a disability? 
  PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  The parent requested a Due Process hearing on December 13, 2004.  At a prehearing 
conference the hearing officer was informed the original request was for an advisory 
opinion and the parties wished to pursue mediation.  A letter from counsel for the Local 
Board of Education (LEA) confirmed they were in the process of scheduling dates.  The 
State Department of Education informed the hearing officer the mediation was scheduled 
for January 18, 2005.  On the morning of January 18, 2005,  the hearing officer received 

a voicemail message from the parent stating they would not be attending the mediation 
session on that date and that she would reschedule the mediation. To the knowledge of 
the hearing officer, the mediation was never rescheduled.  
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  1. The case is dismissed without prejudice.
