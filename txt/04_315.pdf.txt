Hearing Officer  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER ISSUES:  1.  Whether the transportation provided to the Student as a related service of her special 
education program must be less than one hour each way. 
 2.  Whether the Board failed to convene a PPT meeting regarding this transportation 

issue.  SUMMARY:  This matter was assigned on September 28, 2004.  A prehearing conference was 
held on October 6.    The Parents&#8482; attorney submitted a Motion for Stay Put, and briefs were submitted 
by both parties. The stay put provision of the IDEA states that &#64257;[t]he child shall remain in 
the then-current educational placement of such child&#64258; during the pendency of any 
proceedings conducted in accordance with the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415(i)(2)(B)(i).  
The change in transportation schedule was found to not result in a change in educational placement for the purposes of stay put.  Therefore, the Parents&#8482; Motion for Stay Put was 
denied.  On the first day of hearing on November 16, the parties reported that the case was 
settled.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The matter is 
DISMISSED, with prejudice.
