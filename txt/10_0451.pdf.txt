ISSUES: 1. Is the Board&#8482;s psychological evaluation of the Student conducted in January and February 2010 appropriate? 2. If not, are the Parents entitled to an independent evaluation at public expense? PROCEDURAL HISTORY: The Board&#8482;s attorney faxed and mailed a letter requesting a due 
process hearing to the State 
Department of Education, which was received on Ma
y 28, 2010.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on June 2, 2010. On June 10, 2010, 
a prehearing conference was held with the attorneys for the Board and the Parents. Two hearing dates were agreed 
on for July 12, 2010 and July 15, 2010 which was beyond the July 12, 2010 mailing date for the final decision.  On J
une 25, 2010, the Board&#8482;s attorney sent a letter advising 
the Hearing Officer that a critical witness was not av
ailable on the dates agreed on.  The Board&#8482;s attorney requested that the hearing be postponed to the last week of July when th
e witness returned from her vacation 
and that the mailing date for the final decision be exte
nded to allow for scheduling mutually agreeable hearing 
dates and settlement discussion between the parties.  
The requests were granted on June 29, 2010 the hearing was rescheduled for August 18, 2010 and the mailing date for the final decision was extended to September 
13, 2010. The Board&#8482;s attorney advised the Hearing Offi
cer that she and her client would be on vacation during the week of August 18, 2010 and requested another hearing date.  On June 30, 2010, the Parents&#8482; attorney requested a hearing date prior to August 18, 2010 or, in the alternative, that the Board withdraw its hearing request without prejudice.  On July 6, 2010, the Hearing Office
r advised the parties that prior dates were unavailable because of her vacation and offere
d the parties the weeks of August 23, 2010 and August 30, 1
