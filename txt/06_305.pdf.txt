 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
 By notice dated October 12, 2006, the undersigned was appointed by the Department of Education (&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;) as 
due process hearing officer in a matter 
encaptioned &#64257;[Student] v. Regional School Di
strict No. 17&#64258; and assigned DOE case number 06-222.  Included with the notice of 
appointment was a copy of a letter dated 
October 5, 2006 from counsel for the Parent
s to the CTDOE Due Process unit advising that an effort to resolve the dispute through mediation had failed and requesting due 
process.   The CTDOE subsequently advised 
that the case number for this matter should 
be 06-305.  By order dated October 21, 2006, the Hearing Officer denied a sufficiency 
challenge asserted by the District pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(c)(2)(A) based on the October 5, 2006 letter.  The Hearing Officer concluded that the October 5, 2006 letter was on its face insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the IDEIA.  In response to the 
sufficiency challenge, however, the Parents identified a letter dated July 10, 2006 to the District as their request for due process.  The Hearing Officer concluded that that letter satisfied the requirements of 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(c)(2)(A). 
 A telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) convened on October 31, 2006.  Counsel for the Parents (Mr. Klebanoff) and for the District (Ms. Santiago) participated.  The parties reported that this matter i
nvolves the Student&#8482;s programming for the 
2006/2007 school year and that that issue has not previously been subject to a due process hearing or assigned to another hearing officer.  The parties agreed further that it 
would be acceptable to use October 5, 2006 as the starting date for calculating the 75 day clock for issuance of the final decision and order in this matter.  The parties reported that 
over the past several weeks they had been engaged in settlement efforts, that they had 
determined not to proceed with a resoluti
on session scheduled for October 27, 2006 given those discussions and that they were continuing settlement discussions.  By agreement of 
the parties at the PHC and as set forth more fully in a scheduling order issued on
