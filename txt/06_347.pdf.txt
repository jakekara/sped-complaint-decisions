 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
   ISSUE:    1. Whether the Board should be able 
to override the Student&#8482;s lack of  consent and be permitted to conduct a 
psychiatric evaluation of the Student?  
 SUMMARY:   The Student is a nineteen years old young man who has been identified as having 
a specific learning disability and entitled

 On October 19, 2006, the PPT reconvened to determine whether certain, in-school 

conduct constituted a manifestation of the Student

was a manifestation and recommended both 
a psychiatric eval
