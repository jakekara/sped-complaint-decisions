 Appearing before:    Attorney Mary H.B. Gelfman 
      Hearing Officer 
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
   PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  Parent requested this hearing on Decemb
er 16, 2006, and the hearing officer was appointed on December 18, 2006.  In general term
s, the request for hearing stated several questions concerning Student&#8482;s current Indi
vidualized Education Program (IEP) and the 
implementation of that IEP.   
 On December 18, 2006, the hearing officer se
nt out notice for a telephonic pre-hearing conference.  Parent telephoned the hearing officer, stating that she didn&#8482;t want a formal hearing; she wanted the State to investigate 
her son&#8482;s IEP and the implementation of that 
IEP.  The hearing officer responded that her problem sounded as though a complaint to 
the State Department of Education would be 
effective, and suggested that she telephone a specified person in the Due Process Unit.   
 After Parent discussed her problems with a St
ate Department person, they agreed that a 
complaint would be appropriate.  This decisi
on was reported to the hearing officer.  On December 21, 2006, the hearing officer sent out
 a memo delaying the holding of the pre-
hearing conference.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
  Since this matter has been referred for i
nvestigation by the State Department of Education as a complaint, it is DISM
ISSED without prejudice as a hearing.
