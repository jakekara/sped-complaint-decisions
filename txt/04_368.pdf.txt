Strong, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  PROCEDURAL HISTORY   This hearing was requested on November 22, 2004.  This hearing officer was assigned to the case on that date.  A prehearing conference was held on December 1, 2004.  Hearing dates were scheduled for January 5, 19, 21 and 25.  The Parents' attorney requested a 45-day extension of the decision deadline, which was granted.  The decision deadline was extended from January 6 to February 20, 2005.  The parties were directed to file witness lists and exhibits by December 29, which they did.  The Parents filed Exhibits P-1 through P-114.  The Board filed Exhibits B-1 through B-88.   The hearing convened on January 5, 2005.  The parties requested time to discuss a possible settlement.  After one hour, they reported that the case would not settle.  The first matter heard was objections to exhibits.  The Parents objected to Exhibit B-84.  The Board pointed out that it was the same document as Parents' Exhibit P-107.  The objection was overruled.  No other objections were raised to any exhibits, therefore, all were received into evidence as full exhibits. The November 22 request for due process was marked as Hearing Officer Exhibit (HO) 1.  The parties presented opening statements.  The Parents then presented testimony from the Mother.  There was a discussion of the need for more hearing dates.  The Parties agreed to postpone the January 19 hearing date and requested two additional days.  January 27 and February 1 were added and the decision deadline was extended to February 25, 2005.  On January 14, the Parents' attorney filed Parent Exhibit P-115.  On January 21 the Exhibit was entered into evidence without objection.  The Parents presented testimony from Michelle Schneider, an educational consultant.  On January 25, Kristen Viesselman, Clinical Director of Lindamood-Bell in Stamford, testified.  On January 27, the Parents presented the Father's and the Student's testimony and rested their case.
