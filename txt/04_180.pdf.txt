     Hearing Officer       FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
  The prehearing conference in this matter was held on June 30, 2004.  Both parties 
participated and faxed the hearing officer a detailed analysis of the Parents&#8482; concerns in regard to the educational program and progress of their child.  The Parents had wanted an 
independent evaluation and the Board did not agree it was warranted and requested due process.  The parties agreed to have the Board convene a PPT &#64257;in early September&#64258; to 
schedule a complete evaluation to be done by the Board staff.  With the Parents&#8482; request 

for an independent evaluation withdrawn at this time, the Board indicated they would 
withdraw their request for due process.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
