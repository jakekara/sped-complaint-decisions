m of Law before the Prehearing 
Conference.  During the Prehear
in
g Conference, the Board asserted
 
that the Student who is the 
subject of this Hearing Request had been adopted and that the person who filed the Hearing Request 
was the Biological Mother whose parental rights had be

rights.

Hear
ing Request.
