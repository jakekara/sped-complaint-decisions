This matter was originally ﬁled on October 10, 2013. A preheating conference was held on
October 28, 2013. The initial due process hearing was set for December 18, 2013. On October
28, the Parties requested an extension of the resolution period for settlement purposes. That
request was granted. On November 21, 2013 the Parents requested a postponement of the due
process hearing and an extension of the ﬁnal decision and order date. The Parents requested that
the scheduled hearing date of December 18, 2013 be utilized for mediation. The Parties were

instructed to provide an alternate date for the due process hearing in order for the hearing ofﬁcer
to grant the request. On November 26, 2013 the Parents requested that the December 18, 2013
hearing date be postponed until the end of January, 2014 as the Parents were not going to be
available. The request to utilize the December 18, 2013 date for mediation was granted provided
that the due process hearing would be held prior to January 17, 2014 (a date which would be 30
days from the December 18, 2013 hearing date).

On December 18, 2013 the Parents ﬁled an Amended Complaint, which was dated December 21,
2013. The Board ﬁled an objection to the Amended Complaint on December 19, 2013 (stating
that they were not in agreement with amending the complaint) and a second objection to the
Amended Complaint on December 24, 2013 (stating that there were no substantive changes
between the original and the amended complaints, and for that reason should not be allowed).
The Amended Complaint was allowed and the subsequent timelines were adjusted to reﬂect the
ﬁling date of the Amended Complaint. A new due process hearing date was set for February 10,
2014, with a ﬁnal decision and order date set for March 6, 2014.

On February 3, 2014, Counsel for the Parents withdrew their complaint, without prejudice,

stating that the Parties had reached agreement and were formalizing the agreement. Counsel for
the Parents asked that the scheduled hearing date be cancelled.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The Parents withdrew their complaint without prejudice, via Counsel, on February 4, 2014. With
no further issues to be decided, this matter is DISMISSED without prejudice.
