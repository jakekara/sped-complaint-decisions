by telephone conference call on December 11, 2003.  The hearing was scheduled for 
January 9, 2004, allowing for a mediation session scheduled for December 17, 2003.  
When mediation did not resolve the issues, the January 9 hearing session was postponed 
and the parties participated in an advisory opinion proceeding on January 23, 2004.  The hearing convened on February 4, 2004, and concluded on February 25, 2004.  To 
accommodate these dates, the deadline for mailing of the final decision and order was 
extended from January 16 to February 15, and thence to March 16, 2004.
