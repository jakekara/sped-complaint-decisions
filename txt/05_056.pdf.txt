facsimile transmission, the student informed th
e hearing officer that she was withdrawing her request for due process without prejudice.  The day before the pre-hearing conference the Board had convened a PPT and agreed to work with the student to obtain a diploma 

from the Board&#8482;s High School as requested by the student. 
The date for the Final Order and Decision is April 25, 2005.  FINAL ORDER AND DECISION: THE MATTER IS WITHDRAWN WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
