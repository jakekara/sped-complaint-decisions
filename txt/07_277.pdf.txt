  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
  
ISSUES: 
 1. Whether the Student is being deni
ed FAPE in the least restrictive 
environment as a result of changes to 
the IEP which were reportedly made 
on August 24, 2007 by the BOE;  2. Whether the August 24, 2007 changes to the IEP should be voided; 
 3. Whether the Student is entitled to 
two years of compensatory education; 
4. Whether the September 18, 2007 Decision in Case No. 07-224 is 
controlling and the matter should be dismissed; 
 5. Whether the Hearing Of
ficer lacks jurisdiction.   
PROCEDURAL HISTORY: 

 On August 30, 2007, the Parents and Student filed a request for a due process hearing.  On 
September 24, 2007, a prehearing conference was held and the matter was set for hearing on 

November 6 and 7, 2007.  During the prehearing conference, the Boards indicated that they 

intended to file a Motion to Dismiss and a briefi
ng schedule was set for such filing.  Thereafter, 
on October 12 and 17, 2007, the East Lyme and Salem Boards, respectively, filed Motions to 

Dismiss.  Opposition thereto was 
filed on October 23, 2007.   
 The Boards claim that the Hearing Officer lacks ju
risdiction on the basis that (1) the complainant 
seeks the provision of the accommodation of captio
ning for the Morning Show, which is the 
subject of a prior due process hearing and, thus, barred by the doctrines of 
res judicata and collateral estoppel, (2) the complaint resides within the ambit of the State Department of 
Education's compliance/complaint procedures, and 
(3) no relief can be granted against the Salem 
Board of Education.
