FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Was the program offered by the Board for the 2016-2017 school year appropriate and does
it provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least
restrictive environment (LRE)?

2. Does the Student require a residential placement, at public expense, at Grove School for the
2016-2017 school year, including extended school year (ESY), in order to receive FAPE in
the LRE?

3. Is the Student entitled for compensatory education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student is classiﬁed with Emotional Disturbance and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned
in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq.
and Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT)
meeting, the Parents disagreed with the program offered by the Board for the 2016-2017 schoo1
year and requested placement at Grove School at public expense. The Board denied the request.

An impaltial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on July 22, 2016 and a pre-hearing conference held
on July 27, 2016. Notice of the hearing request was received by the Board on July 21, 2016. In
an electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney informed the hearing ofﬁcer that an agreement
had been signed and withdrew the matter with prej udice. The mailing date was extended to
accommodate mediation; the mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is November 4, 2016.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the heating ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4—183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
