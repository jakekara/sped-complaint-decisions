 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  
ISSUES:  1. Was the program and related services offered by the Board for the 2007-
2008 appropriate and provide the Student with FAPE according to 20 USC 
1401 et seq? 2. Should the Board provide an independent assistive technology evaluation 
at the Board&#8482;s expense?  SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY: The Student is a young man who has 
been identified as a student entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as 
defined in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et se
q. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. The Parents rejected the program offered 
to the Student for the 2007-2008 school year. 
The Parents requested a program that cont
ained specific recommendations contained in an independent evaluation conducted by Dr. Tolis. The Board rejected the Parents&#8482; request. On November 1, 2007, a Hearing Officer was 
appointed. A pre-hearing conference was conducted on or about November 6, 2007. The pa
rties requested time to conduct a PPT in 
order to attempt to resolve the matter.
