Appearing on behalf of the Student: Pro se Appearing before:   
Attorney Mary
 Elizabeth Oppenheim, Hearing Officer FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
ISSUE: 1. Whether the Board&#8482;s functional behavioral assessment of the Student is appropriate.   
PROCEDURAL HISTORY: 
The Board submitted this request for hearing on J
une 22, 2009 and a prehearing conference was convened 
on July 15, 2009. The Board&#8482;s requests for extension 
of the mailing date were granted, and this matter 
convened on one hearing date on September 8, 2009.   
At the conclusion of the hearing, the parties were given an opportunity to present closing arguments or 
submit briefs.  The Parents elected to submit briefs, and a brief filing was scheduled for September 15, 
2009. The Board submitted a brief; the Parents did not submit a brief nor did they request an extension of 

the brief filing date prior to the date briefs were due
.  The Parents subsequently requested an extension of the brief filing date which was denied. The Board&#8482;s witnesses were Ann Leffert, Board elemen
tary special education coordinator; Solandy Forte, Center for Children with Special 
Needs behavioral consultant and Mark Palmieri, licensed clinical 
psychologist with the Center for Children with Special Needs. 

The Parents presented no witnesses.1 1 The hearing was scheduled to co
mmence at 10 a.m., but the Parent was not pres
ent.  The Board contacted the Parent, and the Parent arrived at the hearing at approxim
ately 11 a.m.  The Father claimed that he 
had thought the hearing was to commence on 
October 8, 2009, the mailing date of the decision, although both 
parties were sent a Notice of Hearing scheduling the September 
8, 2009 hearing. In addition, counsel for the Board had sent an
 email to the Parent the week be
fore the hearing, referencing t
he September 8, 2009 hearing date and attempting to determine if th
e Parent continued to request an FBA in light of a unilateral 
placement of the Student.  The Parent resp
onded late on September 7, 2009 that he 
was proceeding. [Exhib
it H.O.-2]  Therefore it is concluded that the Parent had notice of this hearing.
