FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Is the program offered by the Board, for the 2012—2013 school year, appropriate and does it provide the
Student with a free and appropriate pub1ic education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE)?

If not;

2. Does the Student require an out of district placement in order to receive FAPE in the LRE?

3. Is the Student entitled to compensatory education for the denial of FAPE for the 2012-2013 school
year?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to‘receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals With
Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10—
76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program offered by the
Board for the 2012—2013 school year. The Parents requested placement at an appropriate out of district
placement for the 2012-2013 school year. The Board refused the Parents’ request. On March 22, 2013, the
Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The parties agreed to go to mediation in place of a
resolution meeting. The mediation session was held on April 24, 2013. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was
appointed on March 22, 2013 and a pre—hearing conference was held on April 2, 2013. Hearing dates of May 21

and 22, 2013 were chosen by the panties.

In an electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties were able to
resolve some of the issues and the remaining issue required additional time to resolve. The Parent’s attorney
requested that the matter be withdrawn without prejudice. There was no objection by the Board. The withdrawal
was granted. The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the
palties’ mediation and the hearing dates. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is June 5, 2013.

F INAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS WITHDRAWN WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
