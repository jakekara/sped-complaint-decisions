Mangs, Hearing Officer            FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   This hearing was requested by the Parent on February 19, 2002.  A prehearing conference was convened on February 28, 2002.  At that time, the Student was attending school within the New Haven school district, but his nexus district was New Milford.  The attorney for New Milford indicated that they had no issues.  A hearing date was set for March 20, 2002 and the New Haven school district indicated that they would also file for due process.  On March 8, 2002, the New Haven school district requested a continuance to await the results of a functional behavioral assessment.  A new hearing date of April 22, 2002 was then set.  On April 15, 2002, the New Haven school district reported that they were withdrawing their request for hearing although the hearing officer is unaware of New Haven having filed such a request.  On April 16, 2002, the parents indicated that they agreed to the withdrawal of all pending matters and stated that the parents&#8482; issues were moot.  Therefore, there are no remaining issues in this hearing.
