SUMMARY:

Student is a 10 year old boy with signiﬁcant and complex educational, emotional, developmental

was home or school—based. Guardian ﬁled a Request for Special Education Due Process Hearing
claiming the Board did not have an appropriate program in place for the Student for the 2011—
2012 and 2012—2013 school years and failed to propose an appropriate program for the Extended

failed to conduct appropriate evaluations of the Student and that the private assessments and
evaluations that she had obtained are appropriate and should be reimbursed by the Board.

under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”). Compensatory education was
requested as a remedy,

receipt of the notice ot‘unilateral placement and offering two dates on which a PPT meeting
could be held: August 20, 2013 and August 26, 2013. (8—17)

65. On August 18, 2013, Guardian sent an email to the ADOS-2 evaluator requesting the

Grade 3, School Psychologist, Speech and Language Pathologist, School Social Worker,
Occupational Therapist, Assistive Technology Evaluator, Acting Assistant Director of Special
Education, Parent Advocate for Guardian and Counsel for the Board and Guardian. (Id.)

74. The purpose of the November 1, 2013 PPT meeting was to review or revise the IEP,
determine continuing eligibility, program review, and review of Triennial Evaluations not
previously discussed. (Id.) The PPT recommended implementation of the IEP developed on
November 1, 2013, implementation of the AT evaluation recommendations (including use of an
IPAD), a psychiatric evaluation to be conducted at Board expense, and postponing ESY
eligibility until the next annual review, which was scheduled for March 13, 2014.

75. On November 1, 2013, the PPT reviewed the AT assessment, ADOS-2, and the
Neuropsychologist’s July 19, 2013 evaluation and heard reports on assessments performed by
classroom teacher at the end 0f2012~2013 year and CMT-MAS results. (B—20) Current goals
and objectives and the service grid were discussed. (Id.) The PPT agreed that Student’s primary
disability should be changed from CPU to Multiple Disabilities. (Id.) While the Prior Written
Notice section of the IEP indicates he proposed actions were refused, the PPT summary makes
clear that the Guardian did not agree with the proposed program. (Id.)

76. On November 8, 2013, Guardian sent a lengthy response to the IEP generated on
November 1, 2013. (P48)

77. In all IEPS developed during the statute of limitations period beginning August 26, 2011,
on the Special Factors, Progress Reporting, Exit Criteria page, the IEP indicates that for students
whose behavior impedes his learning 01‘ that of others, the PPT has considered strategies,
including positive behavioral interventions and suppoﬂs to address that behavior and IEP Goals
and Objectives have been developed to address the behavior. (B-3, B—4, B—9, B-12, B—20, P-17,
P-18, P-33) The list of accommodations to be provided to Student remains equally consistent.
(B-3, B—4, B—9, B—12, B-20, P—17, P-18, P-33)

78. Student’s DRA score on March 13, 2013 was noted as an independent 10 and
instructional 12 on one page and an independent 12 on another. (P—18) The DRA on April 18,
2013 is independent 8 and instructional 12. (B-19)

79, On November 8, 2013, after the hearing had commenced, Dr. El—Fishaway, “Psychiatrist”
whom Guardian retained to treat Student following the incidents of threatening behavior in
December 12, 2012, issued a written report. (P-49) Prior to the commencement of the hearing,
no written report was generated and shared with the school and no evidence was presented in the
hearing that oral communications had occurred between Board staff and the Psychiatrist. By
Virtue of it being generated after the last PPT meetings in March, April and November 012013,
the November 8, 2013 evaluation could not have been shared with the PPT team nor considered
with the team.

80. On December 13, 2013, after the due process hearing had commenced, Guardian’s
Educational Consultant issued a Summary of Information, which summarized the Consultant’s
review 01‘ Student’s educational records and recent evaluations. (P—59) This Summary, by Vittue

13

Ju1y3, 2014 Final Decision and Order 140082

01‘ it being generated after the last PPT meetings in March, April and November of 201 3, could
not have been shared with the PPT team nor considered with the PPT team.

81, Extensive testimony was given on Student’s progress at Villa Maria, the school where
Student was unilaterally placed, (Testimony, Guardian, Villa Maria Admissions Director) The
school provides exclusively small group and one to one Special Education instruction. (Idt) Villa
Maria’s schedule does not indicate a time when speech and language services are offered,
however speech and language services are offered Testimony, ;Admissions Director Villa Maria;
B—21) The schedule does not indicate a time when counseling is offered, however, there is a
social development class on Wednesdays from 12:15—12:55 pm. (Testimony, Guardian; B-21)

82. After February 2012, no further incidents of threatening statements by Student in school
occurred.

83. The IEP Progress Reports generated by Student’s teachers for the 201 1-2012 and 2012-
2013 school year indicate satisfactory progress and eventual mastery by Student of his TEP goals.
(B-6, B-S, B-11, B-13)

84, Achievement testing scores for psycho—educational assessments conducted by Board’s
school psychologist show limited progress in a few areas, with scores remaining stagnant or
declining in others. (T estimony, Neuropsychologist, School Psychologist; P-l, P-36)

85. Board has a policy in which when they hold an Annual Review PPT, and there are
changes to be made to the existing IEP for the remainder of the school year, they issue an IEP
document with those revisions. (Testimony, School Psychologist) The Board a1so issues an IEP
for the upcoming school year, (Id.) As a result of this practice there are occasions when two IEP
documents, are issued with the same date covering two discrete periods of time. (Id.) If there are
no modiﬁcations needed for the period running from the date of the annual review to the end of
the school year, the Board generates one IEP document for the coming school year. (Id.)

86. Student’s Ful1 Scale IQ went from 79 to 85 between Student’s ﬁrst and third grade years.
(Testimony, Schoo1 Psycho1ogist; P-l, P—36) This increase is not statistically signiﬁcant.
(Testimony, School Psychologist)

87. In the 2013 school year, the Board conducted the following evaluations: 2 Lexile results
summaries for the Student’s third grade year; a Psycho—Educalional Evahtation, dated June 3,
2013; an Assistive Technology Evaluation, dated June 4, 2013; an ADOS 2, dated June 17, 2013;
a Speech and Language Triennial Evaluation, dated June 14, 2013; an Occupational Therapy
Evaluation, dated 5/20/2013; and a Qualitative Reading Inventory, not dated but pait of the 2013
Triennial testing packet. (B44, B—15, P—3, P-14, P-35, P-36)

July 3, 2014 Final Decision and Order 14—0082

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DISCUSSION:

A determination of whether or not Board’s program for Student was appropriate must be decided
on a case-by-case basis, in light of an individualized consideration of the unique needs of each
eligible student. Board ofEducafion 0f the Hendrick Hudson Cent Sch. Dist. V. Rowley, 553
IDELR 656. Under Rowley, a two part test must be met to ﬁnd a program appropriate. The ﬁrst
prong of the test requires a ﬁnding that the Board complied with the procedures set forth in the
DEA. Id. The second prong requires a ﬁnding that the IEP was reasonably calculated to enable
the child to receive educational beneﬁts. Id.

PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS

The Guardian alleged the following procedural violations in her brief: failure to allow Guardians
to be equal and/or meaningful participants in the IEP team process, failure to share information
prior to scheduled IEP meetings and failure to convene legal PPT meetings with appropriate staff
at the table In addition to those procedural allegations listed in her Request for Specia1
Education Due Process Hearing, Guardian included a kitchen sink of additional allegations in her
Post Hearing Brief. Speciﬁcally, Guardian alleged the Board violated Student’s Procedural
Safeguards by failing to conduct a Functional Behavioral Analysis and write a Behavioral
Intervention Plan, failing to follow proper procedure when they suspended Student, fai1ing to
follow proper procedure when Student was bullied, and 16 “selected IEP Violations” with a
reference to exhibits where she stated further examples could be found.

Meaningful Participation
For the period beginning in August 26, 201 1, Guardian was invited and attended all scheduled

PPT meetings, with the exception of the meeting she cancelled in June of 201 3, because the
ADOS—2 was not yet complete and the AT evaluation had only just been provided. Guardian
shared information and concerns with the School-Based Members of the PPT. The concerns
raised by Guardian did in some instances lead to modiﬁcations of the IEP, by the PPT.

The recording of Guardian’s concerns and opinions and refused actions were not always
documented on the IEP documents to the extent she would have preferred. Guardian drafted
written responses which she asked to be appended to two IEP documents in 2013 so that her
comments could be accurately and completely reflected in the record The record reﬂects that
Guardian’s written statements to append her comments to the IEP were honored

For the 201 1—2012 academic year, Student mastered the majority of his IEP goals and objectives.
Guardian was invited to attend and did attend a11 PPT meetings during this academic year, When
evaluations obtained by Board and Guardian were tendered for consideration during the 201 1—
2012 academic year at PP’I‘ meetings, modiﬁcations to the IEP resulted. For example, in April
23, 2012, when the PPT met they increased Student’s Special Education hours to include an
additional 215 hours per week oi‘directed reading instruction Concerns raised by Guardian
regarding Student’s eating were considered and addressed in the IEP

Based on a review of the lEPs and Progress Reports and testimony in evidence, there is no basis
for a finding that the Guardian was denied a meaningful opportunity to participate in the PPT
process.

15

July 3, 2014 Final Decision and Order 14-0082

Failure to Share Information before PPT Meeting

The Board did not fail to share information prior to a scheduled IEP meeting. Only one instance
01‘ failing to share information prior to a scheduled IEP was raised in the hearing and that
pertained to the Assistive Technology and ADOS-2 evaluations. The former because it was
tendered a day before the scheduled PPT leaving little time for Guardian to review and evaluate.
In response, Guardian cancelled the meeting.

Concern was expressed regarding a pre—meeting which School Psychologist offered to have
before a PPT meeting to review results of evaluations. Guardian’s belief that such a meeting is
inappropriate, and suggests that the PPT is pre—determining outcomes, is undermined by the fact
she was invited to attend the meeting. An initial exposure to recent test results in advance of a
meeting to discuss those results is an additional opportunity for the Guardian to understand the
results, which did not operate to prejudice the Guardian in any way.

Failure to Convene Legal PPT Meetings with Appropriate Staff at the Table

A procedural violation did occur when the Board failed to have a properly constituted PPT on
March 13, 2014. Pursuant to 34 CFR § 321, the PPT must include: the parents of the child, not
less than one regular education teacher of the child (if the child is in the regular education
environment), not less than one special education teacher of the child, and a representative of the
public agency- who is qualiﬁed to provide or supervise the provision of specially designed
instruction to meet the unique needs of children with disabilities, is knowledgeable about the
general education curriculum and is knowledgeable about the availability of resources for the
public agency, and whenever possible the child with the disability,

By failing to have Director of Special Education at the PPT table on March 13, 2013, the

Board failed to have a properly constituted PPT because he was apparently the only person who
had the authority to discuss resources. The result of the Director’s absence was that Guardian
was forced to wait until another PPT was convened in order to obtain responses to her
outstanding requests. The fact that the next PPT meeting did not occur until April 18, 2013 was a
result of Guardian’s initial unwillingness to attend another PPT meeting and her desire to do
things through email instead. The fact that another PPT meeting had to take place at all, was the
responsibility ofthe Board.

The failure to have the Director of Special Education present at a meeting did not operate to deny
the Student 21 Free Appropriate Public Education because the actions eventually refused by the
Director did not change Student’s receipt of services or special education in the period between
the ﬁrst and follow up PPT meetings (speciﬁcally reimbursement for evaluations already
conducted and ESY placement that hadn’t yet been made)

Functional Behavioral Assessment and Behavioral Intervention Plan and Suspension

The School’s response to the Student’s threatening behavior in School was to call a Crisis
Intewention Team meeting and make recommendations regarding accessing mental health
services outside the school, Aside from one incident in the following Febmary involving a post-it
note that was written by another student, Student’s threatening behaviors did not manifest
themselves again for the rest of the school year. Given that Student’s two threatening incidents

16

July 3, 2014 Final Decision and Order 14-0082

occurred within a week ofeach other and have not occurred since, the evidence shows that
Student learned from this experience and changed his behavior going forward. The Student was
removed from School out ofconcem for his emotional safety and the safety ot‘others, for only so
long as it took to get conﬁrmation that Student was not a threat to himself or others. It is notable
that despite the intervening occurrence of the Sandy Hook tragedy, and the heightened state of
alert of all schools at that time, Student was allowed to return to the school almost immediately.

“Dual” lEP Process

Guardian alleged an inherent procedural violation in the Board’s “dual” lEP document process,
because of the lack of ability to “close out” the lEP that was generated to run from the date of the
lEP (March in the present case) to the end of the academic year. The rights of Student are
preserved by the ability of the PPT to be convened in the beginning of the following year should
the progress reports issued at the end of the year indicate any deﬁciency in Student’s
achievements of his Goals and Objectives.

Failing to Follow Proper Procedures Regarding Bullying

Counsel fails to cite what IDEA procedural safeguard was violated by the Board in her general
statement that alleged violations of the State of Connecticut anti—bullying statute, nor was this
issue explained in Guardian’s pleadings.

Miscellaneous IEP Violations

T0 the extent Guardian has claimed deﬁciencies in the drafting of the Student’s IEP’s, she failed
to explain how each of them operated to deny the Student a F APE. While there were instances
of'mattentive drafting, these did not operate to deny the Student access to his education.

SUBSTANTIVE VIOLATIONS

To demonstrate a child has received an educational beneﬁt, that beneﬁt must be more than de
minimus; there must be some tangible gain in abilities. Polk v. Central Susquehanna
Intermediate Unit 16, 441 IDELR 130 (3d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 111 LRP 3226 , 488 US.
1030 (1989). While the achievement of goals and objectives is one measure of a meaningful
educational beneﬁt, the provision of FAPE does not necessarily require that a student achieve
each lEP goal and objective. Under the IDEA, Student is entitled to receive the services
enumerated in the IEP, but no guarantees are made as to educational success or outcome.

See Wa/czak v. Florida Union Free Sch Dist, 27 LRP 4661 , 142 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. 1998).

2011~2012 SCHOOL YEAR

For the 201 1-2012 academic year, the IEP goals and objectives in the April 4, 201 1 IEP as
subsequently modiﬁed by the October 7, 201 1 and October 28, 201 1 were reasonably calculated
to provide Student with an educational beneﬁt, as evidenced by the satisfactory progress and
mastery of Student’s Goals in Student’s Progress Repotts.

EXTENDED SCHOOL YEAR 2013

Limited evidence was presented on the Board’s and Guardian’s respective proposed programs
for ESY for the 2013 Summer. The ESY program proposed by the Board contained both
academic and counseling components linked to Student’s IEP goals and objectives. Guardian’s

17

 

July 3, 2014 Final Decision and Order 14—0082

unilateral placement of Student in a private camp, because she believed that the Student did not
have a good experience in a prior year was not sufﬁcient to support a ﬁnding that the Board’s
program for the 2013 year was not appropriate and that Student should have been placed in a
private camp without any academic component.

2012-2013 SCHOOL YEAR

The 2012—2013 academic year presented a considerable number of challenges for the Student, the
Guardian and the School—Guardian Relationship. Guardian claims that Student was denied a
FAPE because he was the subject of bullying. ln suppOIt she cited school refusal and anecdotal
instances she observed in school and a bus incident she learned about through her other
grandson. Guardian also cited endorsements made in evaluations she obtained regarding Student.
With the exception of the completion of ratings scale by Board staff it did not appear that there
was direct communication between evaluators and school staff, palticularly as it pertains to the
Student’s perceived issues with peers. Despite repeated statements that suggested that Student
was called weird by multiple students, only one such incident was actually reported and
documented. In that incident Student perceived he was being excluded from sitting with children
on the bus one day, because they said he was weird. The evidence also shows that the School
took appropriate action to address this incident

The evidence is clear that Guardian raised the concern of bullying in September 2012 and again
on March 2013. The School’s response was that they would keep an eye out for that kind of
behavior. Board staff testiﬁed credibly that they didn’t observe this behavior towards Student,
and in fact Student had friends in the school setting. Student’s lack of friendships outside the
school could implicate his ability to generalize social skills to home and the community and it
could also implicate parenting deﬁcits.

The evidence presented at the hearing also demonstrated a disparity between Student’s stagnant
or declining performance on achievement testing over a three year period and Student’s mastery
of IEP goals and objectives as reported by members of the PPT. If the Board had made no
revisions to its lEP when presented with additional relevant information pertaining to Student, it
would be easy to ﬁnd that the achievement scores were ﬂat or declining because of the level of
instruction. This however was not the case, despite Student’s mastery of goals and objectives for
the 2012-2013 school year, the PPT clearly recognized that Student’s unique needs required
greater intervention as time progressed, as evidenced by the steady increase in Special Education
hours and increased service hours for the Student.

The Board ﬁrst proposed a 2013—2014 IEP Program for Student in the spring ot‘2013, This
program was based on Student’s achievement of IEP goals and objectives to date and prior
evaluations. The triennial testing had yet to occur and so could not inform Student’s program at
that time‘ The IEP Goals and Objectives and Services at the time of the initial proposed program
were reasonably calculated to confer a meaningful educational beneﬁt. Upon receipt of the
triennial testing and consideration of Guardian’s IEE, signiﬁcant modiﬁcations were made to the
proposed program as determined on November 1, 2013, These modiﬁcations directly address
concerns raised by Guardian and are grounded in the most recent evaluations of Student. As the
Guardian refused the increase in education and service hours in Spring of 2013, we cannot know

18

July 3, 2014 Final Decision and Order 14—0082

whether or not the proposed changes in Student’s program for the end 01‘ the year would have
begun to address the achievement gap between Student and his peers.

EVALUATIONS

The Board Evaluations 01‘ Student

The Board’s evaluations of Student were appropriate. The Guardian, in her brief, does not
specify which, if any, of the evaluations conducted by or at the request of the Board during the
201 1-2012 and 2012—2013 school years were inappropriate. A review of the exhibits submitted
reveals that no eva1uati0ns conducted by or at the request of the Board during the academic year
of 201 12012 were submitted as an exhibit. For the academic year 0f2012-2013, the Board
evaluations included: Lexile results summaries for the Student’s third grade year; a Psycho-
Educational Evaluation, dated June 3, 2013; an Assistive Technology Evaluation, dated June 4,
2013; an ADOS 2, dated June 17, 2013; a Speech and Language Triennial Evaluation, dated June
14, 2013; an Occupational Therapy Evaluation, dated 5/20/2013; and a Qualitative Reading
Inventory, not dated but part of the 2013 Triennial testing packet. These evaluations did not
appear to have any deﬁciencies on their face.

The Guardian appears to be asking the Hearing Ofﬁcer to make inconsistent ﬁndings. She is
requesting a ﬁnding that the evaluations provided by the Board in the instant years were
inappropriate, while simultaneously requesting that the Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnd the
Ncuropsychologist’s and the Educational Consultant’s critiques of the Board’s program for the
Student credible, even though to a signiﬁcant extent both professionals re1y on the Board’s own
testing resu1ts to support their claims. No evidence was offered that the data utilized by the
Board in conducting its evaluations was compromised. No evidence was offered that the
professionals employed or retained by the Board to conduct the evaluations and assessments
were inexperienced 0r lacked the skills to successfully perform the assessments and evaluations
and analyze and report the data co1lected. In the absence any such evidence, it cannot be
concluded that the Board’s evaluations were inappropriate.

To the extend Guardian claims evaluations were not done that should have been, the evidence
shows that the Guardian chose not to participate in a PPT to discuss the evaluations that had been
done for the triennial until ordered to (10 so in November. This choice precluded a discussion of
whether those triennial tests were appropriate and sufﬁcient to gain a full understanding of the
Student.

It is difﬁcult to ascertain from Guardian’s brief which eva1uations Guardian is requesting be
found appropriate. In Guardian’s brief, she lists several private evaluations obtained by the
Guardian: A 201 1 evaluation conducted by the CT Center for ADHD (a document not in
evidence having been excluded due to untimely submission); a 2012 Virginia
neuropsychological evaluation (conducted for the purpose of litigation arising from Student’s
traumatic brain injury and shared informally with School Psychologist); 2013 Connecticut
Neuropsychologieal Evaluation (conducted after the Triennial Evaluation);

2013 Psychiatric Evaluation (generated after the commencement of the due process hearing).

34 CF R § 300.502 (b) sets out the criteria that must be met in order for a Parent to be entitled to
an Independent Educational Evaluation at public expense. The ﬁrst criteria is that there must be

must either ﬁle a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that its evaluation is
appropriate; 01' ensure that an IEE is provided at public expense, unless the agency demonstrates
in a hearing pursuant to 34 CFR §§300.507 through 300.513 that the evaluation obtained by the
parent did not meet agency criteria CFR § 300.502 (b)(2) (i) and (ii)

In the present case, the Guardian has not provided evidence that the Guardian disagreed with
any of the evaluations conducted by the Board staff or at Board’s request. As there was no
disagreement, there could be no request for an IEE in response to the disagreement, nor was any
such request documented. As the Guardian has not met the threshold requirements necessary to
trigger analysis of whether the Guardian is entitled to an IEE at public expense, the Hearing
Ofﬁcer lacks the authority to order that an IEE be conducted at public expense.

The Hearing Ofﬁcer’s authority to order reimbursement as a remedy must have some basis in
law. Guardian does not cite any legal authority entitling her to reimbursement for reimbursement
of the emergency room visit relating to the Board’s request for completion of a safe to return
form or the counseling provided by the Yale Child Study Center Outpatient Program.

Guardian’s assertion that the Board required a psychiatric evaluation before the child could be
returned to school is unsupported by the evidence. The Return to Schoo1 Form states that a
psychologist or psychiatrist needed to execute the form before the Student would be a110wed
back in school. It is undisputed that upon receipt of the Return to School form completed by a
psychiatric APRN at Yale New Haven Hospital the Student was allowed to return to school the
next day. It is unclear what led to Guardian’s belief that a psychiatric eva1uation was required
afler the Student was allowed back to school. In any event, whatever actions were taken by Dr.
El-Fishaway at the request of the Guardian, no report or written evaluation was generated by him
until after the due process hearing began and no comnmnications between the school and the
psychiatrist ever took place.

Counseling was suggested by the CIT after the December 12, 2012 incident and a list 01‘
community resources was provided to the Guardian. There is no evidence to support a ﬁnding
that counseling was required by the school system. The Yale-New Haven Hospital psychiatric
APRN indicated that follow up wou1d be with the Yale Child Study Center on the Return to
School form. The decision to seek counsehng at the Ya1e Child Study Center or through any
other provider was that of the Guardian.

REIMBURSEMENT

In order to be entitled to receive reimbursement for the cost of Guardian’s unilateral placement
of Student at Villa Maria, it must ﬁrst be demonstrated that the Board’s program was
inappropriate to meet Student’s needs. Once this is established, Guardian’s chosen placement
must be shown to be appropriate for Student. Finally, equitable factors must be found weigh in
favor ofreimbursement. T. Y. v. New York City Dep’l QfEduc., 53 IDELR 69 (2d Cir. 2009), cert.

July 3, 2014 Final Decision and Order 14-0082

denied, 1 10 LRP 28696 , 130 S. Ct. 3277 (2010). The placement selected by Guardian may be
found to be appropriate by a hearing ofﬁcer or a court even if it does not meet the State standards
that apply to education provided by the SBA and LEAs. 34 FR § 300.148 (0)

In the present matter, because the Board has met its burden of establishing that its program for
the Student is appropriate, a ﬁnding that Villa Maria was appropriate is unnecessary.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The Board’s program for the 201 1—2012, 2012—2013, 2013 ESY 2013—2014 academic years were
appropriate.

The evaluations conducted by the Board and at the request 01‘ the Guardian were appropriate.

The Board is ordered to implement the testing and/or evaluation components set forth in the
November 1, 2013 IEP, as soon as is possible so that the Student may be evaluated and a PPT
meeting be held without delay to review the evaluation and develop appropriate programming
for the Student going forward.

No compensatory education is awarded.
