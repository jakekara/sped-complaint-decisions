FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Did the District err when it determined that the Student’s conduct on 12/17/2015 was not
a manifestation of his disability?

2. Did the District fail to provide Student with a Free Appropriate Public Education for the
2014—201 5 academic year?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On Februaiy 20, 2015, the Hartford Board of Education received a request for a Special
Education Due Process Hearing containing an issue requiring an expedited hearing and another
issue which was not expedited in nature. During the preheating conference held on February 25,
2015, hearing dates ofMarch 6, 2015, March 10, 2015, and March 11, 2015 were set. Counsel
agreed during the preheating conference that the hearing should be bifurcated due to the
expedited nature of Issue 1 and the non-expedited nature of Issue 2. The mailing deadline for
the Final Decision and Order for the expedited matter was established as March 20, 2015 and the
mailing deadline for the Final Decision and Order for the non—expedited matter was established
as May 6, 2015.

On March 3, 2015, Attorney for the Student sent correspondence to the Hearing Ofﬁcer in which
she indicated both the expedited and non-expedited issues had been resolved and that Student
was withdrawing his Special Education Due Process Hearing Request

F INAL DECISION AND ORDER:

In light of the above facts, the case is dismissed.

 

' If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescn‘ption of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after '
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescn'ption of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
