October 1, 2013 Final Decision and Order 14—0087

September 30, 2013, to consider both the Board’s Motion to Dismiss and the Parents and
Student’s Motion for Stay Put Placement.

SUMMARY:

The Parents and Student brought the Due Process Complaint alleging that in March 0120 1 3
the Board had violated the confidentiality provision of a previously executed settlement
agreement. The private settlement agreement was negotiated between the parties with the
assistance of their counsel and without reson t0 the IDEA regulatory mediation or
resolution processes contained in 34 CFR §508 01‘ 34 CFR §510. The settlement agreement
contained a provision requiring the patties to keep the terms ol‘the settlement agreement
“conﬁdential except insofar as is necessary to enforce the Agreement.” The settlement
agreement anticipated that Student would graduate from the negotiated educational
placement in August 2012 and released the Board from obligations to provide further
programming for the 2013—2014 school year. The settlement agreement states that the
agreement is binding and enforceable in any state court of competent jurisdiction 01‘ in a

F ederal District Court.

The Complaint alleges that the breach 01‘ the conﬁdentiality provision of the settlement
agreement is a violation of 20 U.S.C. §1417(c) and 34 CFR 3001622, 34 CFR 300.623 and
34 CFR 300.625. The Complaint also alleges that the Violation of the conﬁdentiality
provision nulliﬁes the entire agreement and thus, the Board was required to develop and
plan an appropriate program for Student for the 2013-2014 school year, Parents and
Student allege that the Board was required to plan and develop a second transition year at
the Grove School because of the Board’s alleged breach Ofconﬁdentiality.

The Due Process Complaint seeks 1) a determination that the Board violated the IDEA by
failing to plan and develop an appropriate educational program for Student for the 2013~
2014 school year when it allegedly breached the conﬁdentiality provision of the Settlement
Agreement and 2) a determination that the alleged breach of the conﬁdentiality of the
settlement agreement is a due process violation under the Individual Disabilities Education
Act, 20 U.S.C. §1417(c). The Parents and Student also ﬁled a Motion for Stay Put
Placement under 20 USC. § 14150) and 34 CFR 300.518.

The Board moved to dismiss the entire Complaint on the grounds that l) the Hearing
Ofﬁcer lacks jurisdiction to enforce the parties’ settlement agreement and 2) the Hearing
Ofﬁcer lacks jurisdiction to consider violations Ofconl‘identiality under 20 U .S.C. §1417(c)
because those rights are enforced under 20 USC. §1232g (also known as “FERPA”),

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION:

This matter was heard as a contested case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes
(C.G.S.) §10-76h and related regulations, 20 United States Code §1415(f) and related
regulations, and in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (U.A.P.A.),
C.G.S. §§4-l766 t0 4-178, inclusive, §§4—181a and 4—186.

FINDINGS OF FACT:

The following facts are undisputed by the parties and are material to the Hearing Ofﬁcer’s
decision.

1.

Student is now 19 years ot‘age (birth date July 6, 1994) and was receiving special
education services under the category ol‘disability ot’Emotional Disturbance. (Due
Process Complaint.)

Student was placed at Grove School, a therapeutic day clinical program, under an
Individualized Education Program (IEP) dated December 20, 201 1. (Board’s
Opposition to Parents and Student’s Motion for Stay Put Placement, Exhibit A)

Subsequently, Parents unilaterally placed Student in the residential program at Grove
School. (Due Process Complaint)

Thereafter, the parties entered into a private settlement agreement (“Settlement
Agreement”) after a Planning and Placement Team (PPT) meeting. The parties arrived
at the settlement agreement as a result of direct negotiation with the Board agreeing to
pay certain amounts in consideration for releases and waiver of future claims under the
IDEA, FERPA, and Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the Parents
and Student as to the Board’s obligations to provide programming for the 201 1-2012
school year and beyond. (Representations of Board and Parents and Student counsel at
September 30, 2013 hearing)

Both palties and their counsel signed the Settlement Agreement in October of 2012.

educational and related services after August 2013 at any point in the future.
(Board Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit A) (Emphasis supplied)

7. Paragraph 12 of the Settlement Agreement states:

8.

The Parents and the Student agree this Agreement shall be kept confidential
except insofar as is necessary to enforce the Agreement. The parties
acknowledge that the terms of this Agreement may not be disclosed and/or
used as evidence in any subsequent due process hearing or civil proceeding

Paragraph 13 0f the Settlement Agreement states:
The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement is legally binding upon the

parties and en/bt'ceable in any State court Ofcompetentjurisdiction 01' in a

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DISCUSSION:

1.

D.)

This administrative hearing was commenced pursuant to the IDEA and applicable
Connecticut special education law. Pursuant to the IDEA, a local educational agency
("LEA") is responsible for providing disabled children within its jurisdiction with a free
and appropriate public education program (“FAPE “) in the least restrictive
environment (“LRE”). See 20 U.S‘C. §§ I412(a)(1); 1412(a)(5)(A). When there is a
disagreement between the parents of such a child and the LEA over whether the LEA
has satisﬁed its obligations under the IDEA, the parents may commence a special
education due process hearing and thereafter seek review 0fthe hearing ofﬁcer's
decision by a court if they are aggrieved by that decision.

Under the IDEA, where the parents ot‘a child challenge a special education program
proposed by an LEA, the issue to be resolved is whether the LEA‘s proposed program
provides the child with a FAPE as determined by applying the two prong test stated in
Board Q/Education afHendrick Hudson School District v. Rowley, 458 US. 1 76, 206-
07 (1982)

Under Rowley, the Board‘s program would provide the Student with a FAPE if the
proposed Individualized Education Plan ("IEP"): (1) was developed in compliance with
the IDEA's procedural requirements; and (2) was "reasonably calculated to enable [the
Student] to receive educational benefits," or, in other words, "likely" to produce more

4

October 1, 2013 Final Decision and Order 14—0087

than trivial or de minimis progress. Id. The IDEA does not require that the Board
provide the best program money can buy or provide a program that has all of the
features that the Parents desire.

4. The subject matter jurisdiction of IDEA due process hearings and impartial hearing
ofﬁcers is deﬁned under state and federal law. The IDEA states that impartial hearing
ofﬁcers and due process hearings are to decide issues outlined in 20 U 8.0
§1415(b)(6)(A) or (k)]. 20 U.S.C. §1415(b)(6)(A) deﬁnes the subject matter as
“mallerﬂyj relating to the identification, evaluation, or educationalplacement 0f the
child, or the provision afafree appropriate public education to such child 20 U. S. C.
§1415(b)(6)(A) and see also, 20 USC. §l4l5(f)(1)(A). The hearings are a means of
resolving complaints when an LEA either “(A ) proposes to initiate or change; or (B)
refuses to initiate or change, the identification, evaluation, or educationalplacemenl 0f
the child, or the provision ofaﬁ‘ee appropriate public education to the child. ” 20
U.S.C. §1415(b)(7)(A)(III).

5. §10—76h 0f the Connecticut General Statutes conﬁnes the jurisdiction of Hearing
Ofﬁcers to conﬁrming, modifying 01‘ rejecting the identiﬁcation, evaluation or
educational placement of 01‘ the provision of FAPE to a child, to determining the
appropriateness of a unilateral placement of a child 01' to prescribing alternative special
education programs for a child.

6. The Due Process Complaint alleges that the Board breached the conﬁdentiality of the
Settlement Agreement in Violation of the conﬁdentiality provisions ot‘the IDEA in 20
USC §l4l7(c); 34 CFR §300.622; 34 CFR §300.623 and 34 CFR §300.625. The sole
issue here is the alleged disclosure of the terms of Settlement Agreement itself and not
anything relating to the LEA’S conduct in the “identiﬁcation, evaluation, 01' educational
placement of the child or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such
child.” 20 USC §1 41 5(1)) (6)01). The IDEA requires the promulgation of regulations
with regard to student and parent rights ofconﬁdentiality under 20 USC, §1232g
(FERPA), which has regulatory mechanisms to enforce Parents and Student’s privacy
rights under §1417(c). These procedures are distinct from the present due process
hearing convened under 20 U.S.C. §1415. While there may be instances in which
violations of FERPA may be decided as pait of a due process hearing convened under .
20 U.S.C. §1415 to determine the identiﬁcation, evaluation or educational placement 01‘ j
the provision of FAPE to a child, this is not such an instance.

7. The Board also argues in its Motion to Dismiss that the Hearing Ofﬁcer lacks
jurisdiction to enforce settlement agreements. The Board argues that the Settlement
Agreement was a mediation agreement under 34 CFR §300.506,

] Due Process Ilearing Ofﬁcers also have jurisdiction to decide issues involving alternative
educational settings under 20 U.S.C. §l415(k). The present Due Process Complaint does
not raise any issues relating to alternative educational settings and thus, no discussion is
required.

12.

Parents and Student disagree with the Board’s characterization of the Settlement
Agreement as a mediation agreement. They also argue that the Hearing Officer always
has jurisdiction to enforce settlement agreements including the jurisdiction to decide
whether they have been breached. Parents and Student argue that the Hearing Ofﬁcer
should ﬁrst ﬁnd the Board in breach and nullify the Settlement Agreement and then
determine whether the Board provided FAPE by failing to develop and plan an
appropriate educational program for the 2013-2014 school year.

Both parties agree that the Settlement Agreement settled the Board’s obligations and
the provision FAPE for the 2013-2014 school year. Both parties agree that the alleged
breach of the agreement is what gives rise to the Due Process Complaint in this case.
Both parties agree that the issues of FAPE in the 2013-2014 school year cannot be
addressed by the Hearing Ofﬁcer without ﬁrst deciding the enforceability and facts
relating to the alleged breach of the Settlement Agreement, Parents and Student do not
make any claims that the Board violated FAPE by failing to implement the Settlement
Agreement.

The Settlement Agreement at issue is a private agreement outside the IDEA statutory
mechanisms. It is neither a mediation agreement arrived at after mediation with a SEA
appointed mediator under 34 CFR §506 nor an agreement as a result of the resolution
process described in 34 CFR §510. The IDEA confers jurisdiction on state and federal
courts to enforce these mediation and resolution agreements.

Private settlement agreements lie outside the purview of the IDEA’s statutory
framework and are matters for state courts. See Hoeoye Central School District v. S. V,
56 IDELR 6 (USDC Western District NY)(2011). The present Settlement Agreement
states in paragraph 13 that “this Agreement is legally binding upon the parties and
enforceable in any State court of competent jurisdiction 01' in a district court of the
United States.” Determining whether there has been a breach by the Board under these
circumstances necessarily involve interpretation Ofstate common law of contracts and
faet—ﬁnding unrelated to the jurisdiction of the Hearing Ofﬁcer to determine
“identiﬁcation, evaluation 01‘ education of or provision of FAPE to the student, or the
determination of unilateral placement of the student or alternative education programs
for the student.” See Conn. Gen. Stat §10—76h(d)(1) and R.C.S.A. §10-76h—3, The
Hearing Ofﬁcer thus concludes that she does not have subject matterjurisdietion to
determine the enforceability of the Settlement Agreement. See H.B, v. Colton—
Pierrepont Central School District, 34] FedAppx 687, 690 (2d Cir 2009).

There is no need to address the issues of Stay Put placement because the Hearing
Officer lacks subject matter jurisdiction to decide the issues raised in the Complaint.
Accordingly, the Board’s Motion to Dismiss is granted

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

The Board’s MOTION TO DISMISS is hereby GRANTED and the matter is DISMISSED.
