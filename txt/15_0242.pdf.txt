FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Was the Student’s behavior a manifestation of his disability? If so;
2. Is maintaining the Student’s current placement substantially likely to result in injury to the
Student or to others?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as Hearing Impaired and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in
the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq.
and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT)
meeting, the legal guardians objected to the proposed expulsion of the Student. The guardians
requested that the Student be maintained in his current placement. The Board refused the
guardians’ request. On November 23, 2014, the Board received notice of the guardians’ request
for due process. The parties agreed to waive a resolution session and go to mediation.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on November 24, 2014 and a pre-hearing conference
was held on December 1, 2014. The parties chose December 22 and 23, 2014 as hearing dates. On
November 24, 2014, the parties agreed to postpone the expulsion hearing and agreed to a
temporary change in placement during the postponement of the expulsion hearing. On
December 5, 2014, the Board ﬁled a Motion to Implead the Magnet School the Student attended.

In an electronic transmission dated December 18, 2104, the guardians’ attorney requested that
the matter be withdrawn as the parties had ratified a stipulated agreement. The withdrawal was
granted. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is January 20, 2015.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
