SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

appropriate public education (FAPE) as deﬁned in the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Improvement Act (IDEA) 2O U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a. At a
PPT meeting, the Parent objected to the Board’s inability to provide the Student an appropriate
program for the 2010—201 1 school year. The Board denied the Parent’s allegation.

On September 9, 201 1, the Board received notice of the Parent’s request for due process. The
parties agreed to a resolution meeting. The meeting was scheduled for September 21, 201 1. An
impaltial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on September 12, 201 1 and a prehearing conference was
held on September 16, 2011. Hearing dates of November 9 and 10, 2011 were chosen by the
patties. The Parent amended the complaint on September 19, 2011 and the timelines for the
mailing of the Final Decision and Order were revised. The palties requested cancellation of the
hearing dates to allow the palties to proceed with mediation. The request was granted.

111 an electronic transmission, the Parent’s attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties were
able to resolve the matter in mediation and that the matter was withdrawn with prejudice. The
