     FINAL DECISION  
 The issues in this matter included matters of re
sidency and the parties agreed to postpone the date for mailing of the final decision in this due 
process matter until a date
 that would allow them 
to complete the residency hearing that had 
already begun.  The residency hearing had been continued to a second date at the parent&#8482;s request.  Both parties participated in the due process prehearing conference and a hearing 
date was selected that allowed the residency hearing to be concluded.  Prior to the first day of this due pr
ocess hearing the parties reported that the matter 
had been resolved and the parent withdrew her request for due process.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
  The hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
