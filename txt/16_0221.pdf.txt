On October 28, 2015, the Board received a special education due process hearing request ﬁled by
Student. The undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on October 29, 2015 During the prehearing
conference held on November 18, 2015, a hearing date of F ebmary 2, 2015 was set and the deadline for
mailing the ﬁnal decision and order was established as Monday, January 11, 2016. This deadline was
extended during the prehearing conference at the request of the parties in order to accommodate the
agreed upon hearing date schedule and F ebruary 10, 2015 was set as the new deadline for the mailing of
the ﬁnal decision and order.

On November 19, 2015, the Board ﬁled a separate request for a due process hearing which was assigned
to Hearing Ofﬁcer Bird and was assigned the case number 16—0255. On December 28, 2015, the Board
ﬁled a motion with Hearing Ofﬁcer Bird in which she moved to consolidate the two cases. On J anuary
14, 2016, Hearing Ofﬁcer Bird ordered a consolidation of ease 16-0221 and 16-0225 with the
undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer. At the time of the consolidation, Case 16-0255 had a mailing deadline of
January 29, 2016, as this was the earlier of the two existing deadlines in the separate matters; the
undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer adopted J anuary 29, 2016 as the mailing deadline for the consolidated

2

 

June 17, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0221/16-0255

matter pursuant to her authority under R.S.C.A. §10—76h-10(t)(3) to make any orders concerning
proceeding as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. On January 25, 2016, a second prehearing
conference was held to address scheduling issues resulting from the consolidation. During the
conference, the panics requested that the February 2, 2016 hearing date be postponed and the mailing
deadline be extended due to the need to prepare to present evidence on both cases in the same hearing.
These requests were granted. The parties agreed to set new hearing dates of March 30, 2016, April 4,
2016, April 5, 2016, April 7, 2016, Apri128, 2016 April 29, 2016 and May 2, 2016 and the deadline for
mailing the ﬁnal decision and order was extended to February 26, 2016.

Another request to extend the mailing deadline was made on F ebruary 26, 2016 in order to
accommodate the agreed upon hearing date schedule and this request was granted. The new mailing
deadline was established as March 25, 2016. Via email dated March 17, 2016, Board’s attorney
requested a thirty day postponement of the mailing deadline in order to accommodate the ﬁrst scheduled
hearing date. On March 21, 2016, Patent sent an email in which he also requested an extension of the
mailing deadline in order to accommodate the ﬁrst scheduled hearing date. These requests were granted
and resulted in a mailing deadline of April 22, 2016. On March 29, 2016, Parent requested the
postponement of the April 4th, 5th and 7th hearing dates due to an unforeseen, urgent need to travel for
business. The Board did not object to Parent’s request, which was granted by the Hearing Ofﬁcer after a
consideration of all of the relevant factors under R.S.C.A. § 10-76-h(9)(d)(1—4).

On the ﬁrst hearing date of March 30, 2016, the parties jointly requested an extension of the deadline for
the mailing of the ﬁnal decision and order in order to accommodate the additional hearing dates which
were scheduled to make up for the three dates that had been postponed at Parents’ request. This request
was granted and resulted in a new deadline for the mailing of the ﬁnal decision and order of May 20,
2016. A Revised Notice of Hearing Dates was issued on April 18, 2016 which included the following
dates which had been chosen by the Panties on the March 30, 2016 hearing date: April 28, 2016, April
29, 2016, May 2, 2016, May 1 1, 2016 (this date was noted as tentative as it was contingent on another
matter, in which Attorney Moses was involved, settling), May 24, 2016, June 22, 2016 and June 24,
2016.

On May 2, 2016, Parent requested an extension of the mailing deadline to accommodate the May 24,
2016 hearing date. There was no objection to this request from the Board and the request was granted
and resulted in a new deadline for the mailing of the ﬁnal decision and order of June 17, 2016. This
extension was also documented in an email sent to the Parties on May 18, 2016. Additional dates of
hearing were held on April 28, April 29, and May 2. May 11, 2016 was not utilized as a hearing date
because Attorney Moses’s other matter on that date did not settle.

On May 16, 2016, Parent ﬁled a Motion for Postponement of Hearing, in which he requested that the
next scheduled hearing date of May 24, 2016 be postponed, due to another business trip. On May 17,
2016, the Board ﬁled an Objection of Fairﬁeld Board to Parent’s Motion for Postponement of Hearing.
Although Parent’s motion to postpone the hearing date was filed more than 5 business day before the
hearing date and thus timely pursuant to R.C.S.A. § 10-76h—9, the granting of requests for postponement
are discretionary. Under R.C.S.A. § lO—76h—9, a postponement request may only be made after
consideration of the cumulative impact of the following factors: (1) the extent of danger to the child’s
educational interest or well being which might be occasioned by the delay; (2) the need of a party for

3

 

June 17, 2016 Final Decision and Order 16-0221/16-0255

additional time to prepare and present the pa1ty’s position at the hearing in accordance with the
requirements of due process; (3) any ﬁnancial or other detrimental consequences likely to be suffered by
a party in the event of delay; and (4) whethe1 them has already been a delay in the pioceeding thiough
the actions of one of the parties. After a full considelation of these factors, Parent 5 request to postpone
a fourth hearing date was denied on May 19 2016.

On May 19, 2016, the Hearing Ofﬁcer informed the Parties that if Parent’s remaining witness was not
available on May 24, 2016, then the Board would be directed to begin its case and Parent’s last witness
would be taken out of turn. Parent responded indicating again that he was not available next week. On
May 23, 2016, the Hearing Ofﬁcer sent an email to the parties in which she stated that if either party did
not appear the matter was subject to dismissal and/or default pursuant to the Regulations of Connecticut
State Agencies. Parent responded with an email indicating that the Parents were resting their case and
didn’t plan to call any more witnesses and moved to cancel the next day’s hearing date. It should be
noted that Parent was not in a position to rest his case because cross-examination of Parent’s witness had
not yet been completed and the Hearing Ofﬁcer would not accept such a representation off the record,
while the hearing was in progress.

On May 24, 2016, the Hearing Ofﬁcer appeared at the F airﬁeld Board of Education building at 10:00
am. and waited 15 minutes for either of Student’s Parents to appear. Neither Parent appeared. At this
time the Hearing Ofﬁcer went on the record. The Attorney for the Board who was present at the
hearing, moved for a dismissal of Parent’s due process hearing request ﬁled under case number, 16-
0221, with prejudice.

This Hearing Ofﬁcer has the authority to grant a motion for an entry of default in or dismissal of a
hearing for failure of a party to appear at a properly noticed scheduled hearing. R.S.C.A. Section 10-
76h—18. The Hearing Ofﬁcer also has the authority to order a default in or dismissal of a hearing sua
sponte. (1d,) Pursuant to this authority, the Hearing Ofﬁcer granted the motion to dismiss Parent’s due
process hearing request with prejudice on the record as a result of Parent’s failure to appear at a properly
noticed hearing. A default judgment in favor of the Board was granted by the Hearing Ofﬁcer in
resolution of the issues presented in the Board’s request. The Board then requested that the Board be
permitted to provide testimony from the Director of Special Education regarding the appropriateness of
its evaluations. R.C.S.A. §10-76h-18 (b) provides that upon granting a motion for default a hearing
ofﬁcer may take evidence and issue such orders as may be necessary, including but not limited to
ordering an educational placement for the child. While the Hearing Ofﬁcer permitted additional
testimony from the Director of Special Education regarding the evaluations conducted, consideration of
such testimony was not deemed necessary to a resolution of the issues before the Hearing Ofﬁcer,
because the appropriateness of the District’s evaluation had been resolved in favor of the District by
Virtue of the default judgment and the placement or program for the child was not an issue presented in
the Board’s hearing request.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

In light of the above facts, Parent’s due process hearing request as set forth in issues 1-5 is dismissed
with prejudice and a default judgment in favor of the Board is entered in the resolution of Issues 6 and 7.

 

If the local or regional board of education 01' the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Educatidn shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state 01' federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
