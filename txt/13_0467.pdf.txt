FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Did the Bloomﬁeld Board of Education (“BOB”) offer the Student a free appropriate
public education in the least restrictive environment?
2. If not, what remedies are appropriate?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student submitted a Request for Impartial Special Education Hearing on May 14, 20131
This Impaltial Hearing Ofﬁcer was assigned to the case on May 15, 2013. A telephonic
prehearing conference was attempted on June 5, 2013, but the Student did not respond to the
telephone call. A few days later, the Student called the Impaltial Hearing Ofﬁcer ex parte and
said she did not wish to pursue the Request for Impartial Special Education Hearing. The
Student was advised to put all communications in writing and to include Counsel for the Board

of Education.

The Impartial Hearing Ofﬁcer did not receive further communication from the Student.
Accordingly, a second prehearing conference was attempted on June 18, 2013. Again, the
Student did not respond to the telephone call. On June 18, 2013, the Impartial Hearing Ofﬁcer
wrote a letter to the Student advising that if the Student did not submit a written request for
dismissal or take steps to prosecute the case by June 25, 2013, the matter would be dismissed. 1

On June 25, 2013, the Student wrote to the Impartial Hearing Ofﬁcer via electronic mail,

conﬁrming the Student’s request that the matter be dismissed.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that Student’s request is granted and this case is dismissed.
