 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
 (Phase I &#338; FAPE/Placement Determination) 
 SUMMARY/OVERVIEW  In the 2006/2007 school year, the Student was a 16 year old identified as an 11th grader attending Hartford Public High School (&#64257;HPHS&#64258;), a Board operated mainstream 
public high school.  He is eligible for special education and related services under the IDEIA on the basis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (&#64257;ADHD&#64258;), and has also been identified as having Oppositional Defiant Disorder (&#64257;ODD&#64258;) and Depressive Disorder &#338; Not Otherwise Specified. 
 The Hearing Officer finds: (1) that the Bo
ard denied the Student a free appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) by failing to definitively articulate at the May 31, 2006 PPT its recommended placement for the 2006/2007 school 
year and by failing to convene a PPT at 
the start of the 2006/2007 school year to address the still unresolved placement issue; (2) that 
as of the May 31, 2006 PPT and each subsequent 
PPT convened since then to date for the Student, an out-of-district therapeutic day program (as that term is defined herein) was the 
placement required to provide the Student with 
a FAPE in the least restrictive environment 
(&#64257;LRE&#64258;) for the 2006/2007 school year; (3) that the Board has not
 denied the Student a FAPE since the October 16, 2006 assault; and (4) that the Mother&#8482;s refusal after October 16, 2006 and in light of her rejection of a placement at the Hartford Transitional Learning Academy 
(&#64257;HTLA&#64258;) or Weaver High School (&#64257;WHS&#64258;), to 
consider a placement at an out-of-district 
therapeutic day program (even on an interim ba
sis pending resolution of the placement issue) 
contributed to the loss of FAPE experienced by the Student after October 16, 2006.1                                                     1  HTLA is a Board-operated school for students in grades K-12 with behavioral and other issues, and 
is the most restrictive in-district setting offered by the 
Board.  WHS is a Board-oper
ated mainstream public high 
school which was the Student&#8482;s home school during the second half of the 2006/2007 school year.
