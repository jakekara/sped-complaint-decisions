FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Does the Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) dated October 26, 2014, created
by the New London Board of Education (“Board”) offer the Student a free and
appropriate public education (“FAPE”) for the 2014—2015 academic years?

2. If the answer to issue number 1 is NO; does the Student require an out-of—district
placement in order to receive a FAPE?

3. If the answer to issue number 2 is Yes; is the Intensive Education Academy an
appropriate placement for the Student to receive a FAPE?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

This complaint was ﬁled by the Parent on November 24, 2014. Due to the holidays the
preheating conference was initially held on December 15, 2014, but the Parent did not
appear. A second preheating conference was held on January 7, 2015 shortly after the
resolution period was completed, but the Board was not present due to a misreading 0f
the prehearing notice by Board personnel but from which the issues listed above were
identiﬁed. An initial due process hearing was scheduled for January 26, 2015. Due to
the Board having temporary personnel issues and misreading the scheduling notice, the
Board did not attain legal counsel until J anuary 20, 2015 whereupon counsel for the
Board requested a change in initial hearing date to allow for proper preparation. The
request was not opposed by the Parent and was subsequently granted. The due process
hearing was moved to February 20, 2015, with an extension of the ﬁnal decision and
order date to March 6, 2015.

The ﬁrst day of the due process hearing was held on F ebruary 20, 2015. The Parent
submitted six exhibits, several of which were objected to by the Board (P3 and P4) as
being incomplete exhibits or unidentiﬁable as to origin or creator. The obj ection was
sustained, P3 as it was also an exhibit of the Board as a complete exhibit, and P4 as it was

hand written in pencil, unsigned and not dated. The Parent had no witnesses to call
besides herself, despite having submitted a list of witnesses. The Board, believing that
the ﬁrst day would be utilized by the Parent, did not have witnesses available for that day.

A second day of hearing was scheduled for March 9, 2015. The Parent was reminded of
the need to submit exhibits and witness lists ﬁve business days before the hearing. On
March 9, 2015 the hearing resumed. The Parent called the Student as a witness and then
rested her case. The Board began its case in chief and called several witnesses, at Which
time the Parent announced that she wished to withdraw the complaint. A recess was
called and the Parties were instructed to see if a settlement could be reached short of a
complete withdrawal. After a thirty minute recess the Board indicated to the hearing
ofﬁcer that no settlement could be reached and that the Parent still wanted to withdraw
the complaint. The hearing resumed and the Parent was asked if the decision was of her
own volition, without coercion, and made understanding the consequences of a
withdrawal. The Parent stated that she understood the consequences, that she was not
being coerced and that she still wanted to withdraw the complaint. After being informed
by the hearing ofﬁcer as to the consequences of doing so “with prejudice” or “without
prejudice”, the Parent withdrew the complaint without prejudice. There was no objection
by the Board as to the withdrawal or the status of being “without prejudice”.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

With the withdrawal of the complaint by the Parent on March 9, 2015, and with no
fuither issues to be decided, this matter is DISMISSED, without prejudice.
