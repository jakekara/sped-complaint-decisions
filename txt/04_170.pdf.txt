Klebanoff & Alfano, P.C. 433 South Main Street, Suite 102 West Hartford, CT  06110

One Constitution Plaza Hartford, CT  06103-1919  Appearing before:     Attorney Mary Elizabeth Oppenheim 
Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUES:    1.  Whether the Student has completed the requirements for graduation. 
 2.  If not, whether the Parents&#8482; proposed placement of the Student at Chapel Haven for 
the 2004-2005 school year is appropriate.  SUMMARY:  This matter was assigned on June 16, 2004, and a prehearing conference was held 
on June 24.  Prior to the prehearing, the Parents&#8482; attorney filed a motion for an interim 
ruling that the Student be able to participate in graduation.  The Board&#8482;s attorney submitted a response to this request.  An interim ruling was issued which provided that 

the Student shall be permitted to participate in the graduation ceremony.  The interim 
ruling further clarified that neither parties&#8482; actions at the graduation shall prejudice the outcome of the case. Participation with acceptance of a diploma by the Student was not to 

be construed as the Student&#8482;s and the Parents&#8482; agreement that the Student has met the 
requirements for graduation.  Conversely, such 
participation without receipt of a diploma 
would not preclude the Board from maintaining its claim that the Student had met the 
requirements of graduation.
