PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On J une 2, 2015, the Board received a Special Education Due Process Hearing Request ﬁled by
Student and the undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer was assigned to the case on June 3, 2015. During the
Prehearing Conference held on June 23, 2015, hearing dates of July 20, 2015, August 26, 2015 and
September 9, 2015 and September 10, 2015 were set and the deadline for the mailing of the Final
Decision and Order was established as August 14, 2015. On July 9, 2015, the Attorney for the Student
requested that the ﬁrst hearing date be postponed and the mailing deadline extended for settlement
purposes. The Attorney for the Board indicated the Board had no objection to either request and that
the terms of a settlement agreement were being reduced to writing and settlement was anticipated
shortly. Both the postponement and extension request were granted and the new deadline for the
mailing of the Final Decision and Order was established as September 11, 2015. On August 21, 2015,
Attorney for the Student sent an email in which he withdrew the Special Education Due Process
Hearing Request. On August 26, 2015, the matter was dismissed on the record.
