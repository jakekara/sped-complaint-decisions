requested an independent assistive technology evaluation of the student. The Board rejected the Parents&#8482; request. On or about June 23, 2006 the Board sent the Parents a letter advising them that they were
 requesting a due process hearing.  On or about June 23, 2006 an impartial specia
l education hearing officer was appointed to hear the matter. A pre-hearing conferen
ce was held on July 7, 2006 and hearing dates of July 27 and August 11, 2006 were chosen by the parties. The Parents in a letter to the Board withdrew
 their request for an independent assistive technology evaluation. The Board based on the withdrawal of the request for the evaluation withdrew their request for due process.  The date for the final decision and order was extended to accommodate the hearing dates.
