Sullivan, Schoen, Campane & Connon, LLC 
646 Prospect Avenue Hartford, CT  06105-4286   Appearing before:    Attorney Patricia M. Strong, Hearing Officer 
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  PROCEDURAL HISTORY   This hearing request was received at the State Department of Education (SDE) on 
November 17, 2005.  This hearing officer was a
ssigned to the case on that date.  The Board received the request for hearing on November
 22, 2005.  The Parents asked for a Spanish interpreter for the proceedings.  A prehearing conference was held on December 7, 2005 at the 
Board offices with an interpreter, the Parent
s, the Board&#8482;s attorney, the Board&#8482;s Special Education Coordinator and its Interim Lead Nurse.
  Hearing dates were scheduled for January 17 and 23, 2006.  The decision deadline was set at February 6, 2006.   The parties were directed to file witness lists and exhibits by January 10.  The Board filed Exhibits B-1 through B-18 and a witness list.   The Parents had the services of an interpreter provided by the SDE on all the hearing dates.  The hearing convened on January 17, 2006.  The Parents, through the interpreter, presented their case.  They offered an exhibit, but no witness list.  They stated that they would be the only witnesses.  The hearing request was mark
ed as Hearing Officer Exhibit 1 (HO-1).  The Parents&#8482; exhibit was marked for identification as
 P-1.  The first matter heard was objections to 
exhibits.  The Parents did not object to any Board exhibits.  The Board Exhibits were entered as full exhibits.  The Board objected to Parents&#8482; Exhibit 1, which was marked for identification 
subject to later offer into evidence and ruli
ng on objections.  The parties presented opening statements.  The Father, through the interpreter, st
ated that the Parents want a personal nurse for the Student.  They want a nurse who would not have to care for other students.  The Board argued that the Student did not require a one-to-one nurse and that the nursing services offered 
are appropriate.  Parents then presented testimony 
from the Father.  After his cross-examination, 
the Mother testified.  The Parents rested their 
case.  The Board moved to dismiss the case.  
Decision on the motion was deferred.
