  FINDINGS OF FACT:  1.  This hearing was requested on April 23, 2003.  The prehearing conference was convened on April 30, 2003;  the Parent did not appear although the time and date were 
coordinated with the Parent by mail and confirmed by telephone.  During the prehearing 
conference, the Board representative stated that a meeting was scheduled with the Parent 

to give her an opportunity to discuss her concerns.  A thirty day continuance was requested by the Board and granted; a hearing date was set for June 11, 2003.  During the subsequent telephone call with the Parent, the Parent confirmed for the hearing officer 

that a meeting was scheduled; the Parent concurred with the continuance and the hearing 
date.  (Exhibit H.O. 1)  2.  There was no communication between the parties and the hearing officer until a letter 
from the Parent, dated June 5, 2003, was received by the hearing officer.  In the letter, the 
Parent stated that she wanted the hearing to go forward on June 11, 2003 as the matter 
was still unresolved.  (Exhibit H.O. 2)
