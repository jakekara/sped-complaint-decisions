   STATEMENT OF ISSUE   For the reasons set forth herein, hearing proceeded on only one of the three issues presented for hearing by the Mother &#338; the &#64257;Exclusion Claim&#64258; &#338; which concerned the 
Mother&#8482;s report that the Board was excluding the Student from her educational program 
on days when the Student was having her menstrual period as a disciplinary measure.      
 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND   The Mother commenced this proceeding by request dated July 27, 2004.  (Exhibit 

HO1).  She claimed: (1) that during the summer of 2004, the Student had not been 
provided the extended school year (&#64257;ESY&#64258;) programming provided for in her IEP (the 
&#64257;ESY Claim&#64258;); and (2) that school personnel had filed a false report with the Department 
of Children and Families (&#64257;DCF&#64258;) that the Mother was neglecting the Student&#8482;s hygiene 
needs (the &#64257;Referral Claim&#64258;). 
  At the August 11, 2004 telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;), the parties 

disagreed as to why the Student had not been provided with ESY services during the summer of 2004 but agreed that the Student had not been provided with the mandated 
ESY services.  The Hearing Officer advised that should he find for the Mother on the ESY Claim, he would award compensatory e
ducation and direct that a PPT be convened to determine the nature and form of any such compensatory education.  Accordingly, the 

Hearing Officer suggested that the parties continue the hearing to convene a PPT to address the nature and form of compensatory education to be provided to the Student 
given her lack of summer 2004 ESY programming.  The parties agreed to that proposal 
and an initial order was entered on August 16, 2004.  That order directed the parties to convene a PPT and jointly report to the Hearing Officer on or by September 13, 2004 

whether and to what the PPT had resolved the ESY Claim.  The August 16, 2004 order 
also provided, in part, as follows:
