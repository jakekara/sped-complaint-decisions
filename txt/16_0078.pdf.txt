FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Is the program offer by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year appropriate and does it provide
the Student 3 free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment
(LRE)? If not;

2. Does the unilateral placement of the Student at Darrow School for the 2015-2016 school year
provide the Student with a meaningful education?

3. Should the Board be responsible for the cost of the unilateral placement at DaITOW School for the
2015-2016 school year?

4. Is the student entitled to compensatory education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Other Health Impairment-ADHD and is entitled to receive FAPE
as deﬁned in IDEA 20 USC. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a
planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents disagreed with the program provided by the
Board for the 2015—2016 school year and requested reimbursement for their unilateral placement at
Darrow School. The Board refused the Parents’ request and the Parents ﬁled for due process.

On August 6, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The Parents’
agreed to waive a resolution meeting in lieu of mediation. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed
on August 10, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was held on August 19, 2015. A hearing date of
October 30, 2015 was chosen by the parties. In an electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney advised
the hearing ofﬁcer that the matter had been resolved and withdrew the matter with prejudice. The date
for mailing the Final Decision and Order is October 20, 2015.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the healing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereqf, the State Board ofEducati'on shall take appropriate action to enforce the

ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the healing officer may be made to state or federal
court by either palty in accordance With the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415 (i)(2)(A).
