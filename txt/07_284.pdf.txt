 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  ISSUE:  
Whether a special education hearing officer appointed pursuant to 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.511 and Section 10-76h-7, Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (R.C.S.A.), has the authority to require a local board of education to execute a contract with a specific 

service provider, when the services are bei
ng provided by that consultant pursuant to a student&#8482;s Individualized Education Program (IEP)? 
 
 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:
  This hearing was requested on September 10, 
2007, and therefore the date for mailing the 
final decision and order was set at Nove
mber 24, 2007.  A pre-hearing conference was 
held by conference telephone call on October 1, 2007.  Prior to convening the hearing on October 18, 2007, the Board&#8482;s attorney filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the IEP 
services were being provided under a short term contract awaiting Board approval for a 
longer term contract.  Parents expressed concer
n that a delay in providing services at the beginning of the school year and that the de
lay in formalizing the contract make it 
uncertain that IEP services will continue to be provided.   

 
The parties used some time prior to the conveni
ng of the hearing to discuss settlement.  
The hearing convened and the facts of the current program and dispute were placed on 
the record.  A date was set (November 29, 2007)
 to continue the hearing if the matter 
could not be resolved.  The decision date 
was extended from November 24 to December 
24, 2007, to provide for settlement negotiations
.  The hearing officer took the Motion to Dismiss under consideration.
