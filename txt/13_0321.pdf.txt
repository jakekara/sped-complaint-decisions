29, 2012 through January 13, 2013, appropriate for this Student?

1f the answer to the above (No.1) is No, is the Board responsible to provide either
a publicly funded Independent Education Evaluation (“IEE”) or reimburse the
Parents for a privately acquired IEE?

Did the Board provide the Student a free and appropriate public education
(“FAPE”) for the academic years of 201 1—2012 and 2012-2013?

Are the Individualized Education Programs (“IEPS”), dated 5/5/ 1 1, modiﬁed on

offer the Student a FAPE?

Did the Board fail to appropriately identify the Student in all areas of suspected
disability?

Did the Board fail to appropriately implement the accepted IEPS for the time
periods in question?

Did the Board commit a procedural violation by holding the February 14, 2013
Planning and Placement Team (“PPT”) meeting 011 short notice, preventing one
Parent and the South Windsor Board of Education from attending?

Did the Board commit a procedural violation and deny the Parents meaningful
participation by holding a PPT on 5/17/2013 despite neither of the Parents, nor the
Student, being present?

Does the Hearing Ofﬁcer have jurisdiction to address an alleged discriminatory

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The hearing was requested on F ebruary 20, 2013 by the Connecticut Technical
High School System (“CTHSS”) Board of Education, regarding Howell Cheney
Technical High School (“Cheney Tech”) (Case No. 13-0321). The Board’s complaint
involved the sole issue of the appropriateness of the Board evaluation and a decision to
not pay for a parental request for an IEE: The Parents ﬁled a separate complaint on
Febmary 20 and then an amended complaint on February 22, 2013, (Case No. 13—0329)
The Board ﬁled a brief answer to the Parent complaint on February 22, 2013.

This matter was consolidated, at the request of the Parties and agreement 01‘ the
assigned Hearing Ofﬁcers on 2/28/2013, under Case No. 13~0321. On 3/5/2013 a
preheating conference was held, where the issues were identiﬁed for hearing.

On 4/19/2013 the Parties requested an additional prehearing conference to address
a dispute regarding the necessity of the Parents IEE being completed before the Board’s
raised issue of the appropriateness of the Board’s evaluation would be heard and decided.
The Parties agreed to address the issue of the completion of the Pai‘ents’ IEE at the start
of the due process hearings. The hearing addressng that issue began 5/9/2013, and
further convened on 5/30, 5/31, 6/3, 6/6, and 6/7/2013 to address the remaining issues.
The Parties agreed that if the Parents’ 11313 was completed prior to the testimony of the
Board’s expert, there would be no objection to the evaluation being completed aﬁer the
start of the hearing. In order to accommodate professional witnesses, additional hearing
dates were set for 7/26 and 7/27/2013. Concluding hearing dates were held on 8/5; 8/6;
8/7; and 8/8/2013. The Parties rested their cases on 8/8/2013

The ﬁnal decision and order date was extended from 8/14/2013 until 9/13/2013 to
allow the parties to obtain transcripts of the hearings and to prepare ﬁnal briefs.
Consequently the parties developed the following brieﬁng schedule, presuming that
transcripts would be available to the parties by the end of August, 2013:

1. Initial briefs would be due by 9/16/2013;

2, Reply briefs would be due by 9/23/2013;

3. The ﬁnal decision and order would be due by 10/13/2013.

October 1 1, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0321

4. The Palties reached a temporary agreement between themselves to provide
educational services to the Student in such a fashion as to make the necessity
of an extension not detrimental to the Student.

On 9/13/2013, the Parties requested a short extension of the brieﬁng scheduie, adding
three days to the initiai briefs (9/ 19) and t0 the reply brief (9/26). The ﬁnal decision and
order date remains at 10/ 13/2013.

SUMMARY:

This matter concerns a Student diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental
Disorder, Not otherwise Speciﬁed (“PDD NOS”), with Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity
Disorder (“ADHD”). These diagnoses have been sustained over a fairly lengthy period
oftime (2008 through 2013) by a number of evaluators. When transitioning from the
Timothy Edwards Middle School to Cheney Tech, the Middle School psychologist noted
that the Student would seek her out when he needed to problem solve, but that he was not
always receptive to the suggested solutions that were offered. He was seen as a concrete
thinker which diminished his reading comprehension signiﬁcantly. He was also seen as
having a good vocabulary but slow retrieval and oﬁen tried to avoid independent reading.
He beneﬁted from extra time and small test settings when taking standardized testing in
math. The Board attended the meeting in which these attributes of the Student were
discussed and from which the initial Cheney Tech IEP was written 5/5/201 1. On
10/7/201 1, the Board held a PPT meeting to develop a behavior intervention plan
(“BIP”), from which a functional behavioral assessment was conducted and a BIP was
created. Both Mother and Student participated in the PPT meeting.

At the annual PPT conducted 5/3/2012, the Student’s teachers reported a shared
concern that he was at risk of failing three core subjects (English 1, Algebra 1 and Global
Studies (as identiﬁed by the Board». The teachers shared concern was of the Student
complying and completing his work. Although modiﬁcations to the IEP and the behavior
intervention plan (“BIP”) were made which included targeted tutoring twice weekly, co—
taught core subjects at least two periods each class per academic week, continued
counseling and utilization of his BIP, the 5/3/2012 IEP is essentially the same as the
5/5/2011 IEP. The BIP was slightly modiﬁed.

The Parents requested, and the Board convened two additional PPT meetings
prior to the start of the Student’s sophomore year, in June and August to help staff
become acquainted with the Student and the IEP, By early October, 2012, the Parents
were notifying the Board that they had concerns about the Student’s functioning at
Cheney Tech. The Parents believed that the teachers did not understand the impact 01‘ the
Student’s diagnoses on his ability to handle the work load and structure of Cheney Tech.
The Board attempted to convene a PPT meeting in October but was unable to coordinate
all 0fthe schedules to do so until 1 1/1/2012. At the 1 1/1/2012 PPT, the Team came to
the conclusion that a comprehensive evaluation of the Student was warranted. The PPT
was concerned about the Student’s lack of ability to stay in class, sleeping in class and
lack of work completion. The PPT developed a series of ﬁve questions for the evaluator
to respond to in completing the evaluation. The Parents dispute that there was consensus
on the five questions and state that they were denied the ability to ask different questions.
The Board and Parents completed the evaluation permission form, the Team reviewed the

3

October 1 1, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0321

BIP and it was determined that it was still appropriate. The Parents dispute that the BIP
was effective and felt that it did not address the Student’s behaviors in a proper manner,
being focused too strongly on punitive measures, rather than rewarding positive
behaviors.

The Board completed a comprehensive educational evaluation of the Student. The
evaluation was completed in January, 2013‘ On 2/ 14/201 3, the PPT met to review the
comprehensive evaluation and subsequently reconmlended that the Student be returned to
his sending LEA. Mother attended the 2/14/2013 PPT, Father was not able to attend due
to work considerations and had requested that the meeting be postponed, which the Board
declined to do. The Parents disagreed with the PPT, and the comprehensive evaluation,
which the Parents challenged as not being appropriate and requested an IEE at Board
expense, which the Board denied. The Parents subsequently invoked stay-put to
challenge the IEP. The Board ﬁled the initial complaint in defense of their evaluation
and their denial to fund the IEE at public expense. Subsequent to the ﬁling of the
Board’s complaint, the Parents ﬁled their own complaint charging amongst other things,
the Board’s failure to provide a free and appropriate public education (“FAPE”) to the
Student, for the 201 1—2012; 2012—201 3 academic years, and for improperly holding a
planning and placement team (“PPT”) meeting in which a decision was made that the
Student would be removed from Cheney Tech. and sent back to his sending local
educational agency (“LEA”) for the 2013-2014 academic year. The Board subsequently
held two additional PPTS in which the decision to remove the Student from Cheney Tech
was reiterated and suggesting a change in services during the pendency of the due process
complaint.

The Palties subsequently requested the two complaints be consolidated into one,
which occurred upon agreement of the Hearing Ofﬁcers. The Parties then agreed at the
6/3/2013 hearing, to allow the Parents to amend the Parents complaint to include the
2013—2014 IEP in this matter, adding additional issues to be decided. The Board stood by
its decision to remove the Student from Cheney Tech, citing C.G.S. §10—76q] as the
authority allowing the removal and the school’s inability to provide the program and
services necessary to meet the Student’s needs. From the Board’s perspective, the
Student posed a safety threat to himself, and possibly others due to several statements

 

' CiG.S. §lO-76q. Special education at technical high schools. (a) The State Board of Education, in
accordance with regulations adopted by said board, shall: (1) Provide the professional services necessary to
identify, in accordance with section |0—76a, children requiring special education who are enrolled at state
technical high schools, in accordance with section |0-95; (2) identify each such child; (3) determine the
appropriateness of the state technical high school for the educational needs ofeach such child; (4) provide
an appropriate educational program for each such child; (5) maintain a record thereof; and (6) annually
evaluate the progress and accomplishments of special education programs at the state technical high
schools

(b) Where it is deemed appropriate that a child enrolled in a state technical high school receive special
education], the parents or guardian ofsuch child shall have a right to the hearing and appeal process as
provided for in section 10-7611.

(c) lfa planning and placement team detennines that a student requires special education services which
preclude such student’s palticipalion in the vocational education program offered by a technical high
school, the student shalt be refen‘ed to the board of education in the town in which the student resides for
the development of an individualized educational program and such board ofeducation shall be responsible
for the implementation and ﬁnancing of such program

that the Student had made, both in school and out of school, that he was contemplating
suicide. The Student was becoming increasingly deﬁant and refusing to do homework,
listen to the teachers, or work with the obsewer assigned to him. The Parents challenge
that statute, stating that Cheney Tech has a legal requirement to provide a FAPE to the
Student and that the Board may invoke §10-76q only after attempting a full complement
of sewices designed to enable the student to achieve a meaningful educational beneﬁt,
which the Parents feel the Board did not do; and further that the May, 2013 PPT was held
without Parent or Student participation denying them meaningful participation in the
process and thereby a denial of a FAPE.

There is no dispute between the Parties that the Student is a student with a
disability, with a primary disability of autism, and eligible for special education
services pursuant to 20 U.S.C. §1415 et seq. § 1400 et seq. (“IDEA”) under the
disability category ofAutism. (B9, 13.1 of 16)

Prior to attending Cheney Tech, the Student attended the South Windsor Public
Schools, speciﬁcally Timothy Edwards Middle School. (B2,3,5)

While attending Timothy Edwards Middle School the Student attended primarily
regular classes, attending the STEP program for Math and Resource, and
receiving the support of a paraprofessional in Social Studies and Science. (BS, pp.
2, 15 of 29; Testimony, Ti'. 6/7/13 Father, pp. 149—150)

Cheney Tech is a member school of the Connecticut Technical High School
System (“CTHSS”). (Educational Consultant, 5/31/2013, Testimony, Tr. p.26)
CTHSS serves as the Board of Education (“Board”) in this matter.

Cheney Tech held a PPT meeting, including the Parents and the South Windsor
Pub1ic Schools, on 5/5/20] 1 to plan an individualized education program (“IEP”)
for the 2012—2013 school year. (B5)

The Student’s special education teacher in the South Windsor Public Schools
noted at the 5/5/201 1 PPT that the Student made progress behaviorally and
socially since the sixth grade and that he would be attending Cheney T ech during
the 2012-2013 school year, (B5, p.2 of29).

. The Cheney Tech Special Education Chair, who was in attendance at the PPT

meeting, described for the participants that the Cheney Tech schedule rotated
between shop and academic cycles and the importance of homework for students.
(Testimony, Tr. Special Education Department Chair., 8/7/13, p. 125).

Neither the sending LEA, nor the Student, nor the Parents expressed concern with
the rotating schedule or homework requirements in terms of the Student’s ability
to be successful. (Testimony, Tr. Special Education Department Chair., 8/7/13,
pp. 14-16, 125).

The 5/5/201 1 IEP provided that the Student would attend co—taught English,
Math, Social Studies and Science at Cheney Tech, with a behavior plan in place.
(Bd. 6, p.2 0123).

The IEP included three goals: Goal No.1 addressed reading comprehension skills;
Goal No.2 addressed improvement in written language skills and Goal No.3
addressed utilizing strategies to positively respond to situations that cause
frustration and increase the Student’s ability to interact positively with peers.

(B6, pp. 8—10 of23).

The Parents accepted the IEP upon its creation. (B6). The Parents did not request
any changes to the IEP during the 201 1-2012 school years. (8679,10).

A formal behavior intervention plan (“BIP”) was created following a PPT
meeting dated 10/6/2011. (Bd. 7, p. 2 of 3).

The BIP dated 10/7/201 1 resulted from a functional behavioral assessment
conducted by the School Psychologist, after obtaining information from Student’s
special education ﬁle from South Windsor and input from Student’s mother, as
well as data collected by various Cheney Tech staff. (B8).

The BIP, dated 10/7/201 1, identiﬁed three target behaviors: ( 1) Non-compliant
when given a directive; (2) Difﬁculty with task completion/weak organizational

skills, and (3) Inappropriate conunents/ﬁ'ustration. (P 23, p. 1 0f 19). The
function of his behavior was determined to be an attempt to control his
environment. (P 23, p. 2 0f 19).

The BIP indicated that the Student responded well to rephrasing/explanations and
consistent routines, but with his difﬁculty in making decisions, choices were to be
limited to two. (P. 23, p. 5 0f19).

The BIP required that for a violation of a rule for which he could be suspended,
discipline was to be according to the Student Handbook. (P 23, p. 6 of 19).

The BIP indicated that if homework were not turned in, arrangements were to be
made to make up the assignment according to the teacher’s homework policy.
(Id).

Subsequent progress reports, commenting on the 5/3/ 1 1 IEP, indicated that Un-
Satisfactory progress was made on Goal No.1 during the ﬁrst and second quarters,
(B6, p. 18 0123); satisfactory progress was made on Goal No.2 during the ﬁrst
and second quarters, (B6, p. 19 of 23); and Un-satlsfactory progress on all of the
objectives of Goal No. 3 during the ﬁrst and second qualters. (B6, p. 22 01‘ 23).
There were no progress reports for the remaining quarters.

An animal PPT meeting was held on 5/3/2012 in which it was documented that
“Teacher reports were shared and [the Student] is in fear of failing the following
core subjects: English, algebra, and gloabal {sic} studies.” (B9, p.2 of 16).

The 5/3/12 PPT did not report any academic evaluations for any academic area
for the purposes of developing the IEP at this meeting. (B9)

The goals and objectives in the areas of academic/cognitive, social/behavioral,
and transition were developed for this TEP period. (P4, pp. 5-6 of 6).

The PPT continued the same level of academic support for the 2012-2013 school
year that was provided during the 201 1-2012 school year e strategic tutoring
twice per academic week, co—taught English, Math, Social Studies and Science at
least two periods each class per academic week, counseling with the school
psychologist .5 hours per week and implementation of a behavior intervention
plan. (B9, p.2 of16).

The 5/3/2012 BIP was slightly modiﬁed. (P23, pp. 4—6).

The Student achieved passing grades during the 2011—2012 school years, with
additional assistance, except that he failed Global Studies. (P21).

A PPT was convened on 6/1 1/2012, at the request of the Parents, to address and
modify the BIP. (B10). Speciﬁcally the Parents wanted to address the effect of
autism 0n the Student’s perceptions of school and behavior. (B10, p.2 014). An
additional behavior that had been targeted in the BIP, “Difﬁculty interpreting
social cues”, was modiﬁed to provide an example to staff to utilize in
identiﬁcation and resolution of the behaviors. (P23, p. 7).

The identiﬁed function 01“ the Student’s behavior was not modiﬁed or changed for
the remainder of the 2011-2012 and the 2012—201 3 school years. (P23, pp. 5, 8,
12, 16).

The PPT of 6/1 1/2012 modiﬁed the BIP by (a) giving the Student two choices 01‘
alternate behaviors when he failed to follow directions 01' complete his work; (b) a
structured homeroom would be provided to assess homework completion; (c) a

homework buddy would be assigned, and (d) the teacher would provide a prompt
to the Student to write down homework in class. (B l 0, p.2)
The 6/1 1/2012 PPT addressed the issue of encopresis by easing the Student’s
ability to leave the room for the lavatory, and the Parents would provide a change
of clothing for the Student to utilize. (1d).
A PPT meeting was held on 8/28/2012 for the purposes of conducting an
intermediate review for the Student; to introduce the Student and Parent to the
new teachers for the sophomore year, and to provide the regular education
teachers with information about the Student. (B12, p. 2 of 3).
The Parents and Student attended and participated in all of the PPTs held for the
Student during the 201 1-2012 school year, no requests for changes to the relevant
lEP’s were made by the Parents. (B6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Prior to the commencement of the 2012-2013 school year, the entire teaching staff
at Cheney Tech received training on working with students on the ASD (autism
spectrum disorder) from Dr. Ruth Ehems, a professor from Southern Connecticut
State University with expertise in that area. (Testimony, T1'. 8/15/2013, p. 20;
Educational Consultant. 8/7/2013, p. 209—210).
A PPT meeting was convened on 1 1/1/2012 to discuss conducting an evaluation
of the Student. (B12) The Board attempted to schedule the PPT meeting during
10/ 12 but was unable to obtain a date that worked with all the palticipant’s
schedules. (Testimony, Tr. 8/7/2013, Educational Consultant, p.152).
The PPT reached consensus that the Student’s maladaptive behaviors were
“negatively impacting the student’s ability to progress academically and on IEP
goals.” (B12, p.2 of 3; Testimony, Tr. 6/6/13, Father, pp. 40—41).
The 1 1/1/ 12 PPT agreed to move the Triennial Evaluation up as requested by the
Parents (Testimony, Tr. 5/31/13, Educational Consultant, p. 37); agreed to the
following evaluations: (a) ﬁle review of previous performance and observation by
psychologist; (b) interview to evaluate social/emotional functioning; (0) review of
cognitive functioning; (d) social work assessment to determine the impact of
family dynamics on behavior; (e) test of academic functioning in the areas of
reading/writing/math. (B12, p. 2 of 3); further the PPT agreed to implement an
observer, 3 days per week, across settings to gather behavioral data; continue to
utilize the IEP and BIP developed on 6/1 1/ 12; and ﬁnally, to re-convene to
discuss the testing results, hopefully in December (2012) ifpossible. (Id)
The PPT developed the following list of questions for the evaluator:
a. How much time does [Student] spend on task? When is he off task, what
is he doing?
b. What are the academic, social and emotional “triggers” to [Student’s] off
task behaviors?
c. What educational supports are needed to improve [Student’s] on task
behavior?
(1. How does [Student’s] emotional functioning and social awareness impact
[Student’s] academic and social performance in school?
e. What recommendations are suggested for the school and family to support
[Student’s] academic, social and emotional growth?

The substitute teacher (observer) began collecting data on “deﬁance” (P12); “off—
task frequency” (P13) on 11/ 15/ 12. Data on “peer interactions” (P1 1) was not
collected after 12/17/12. (P11, p. 9).

The Board conducted a comprehensive educational evaluation of the Student
between November 29, 2012 and January, 2013, selecting Board Psychologist. as
the evaluator. (Testimony, Tr. 5/31/2013, Educational Consultant, p.41).

The evaluation process, utilized by Board Psychologist included the giving and
scoring of the following evaluation tools:

a. Woodcock—Johnson III Normative Update Tests of Cognitive Abilities and

Achievement;

Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS)

Asperger Syndrome Rating Diagnostic Scale (ASDS)

Conners Rating Scale 3 Teacher Form

Behavior Rating Inventory 01‘ Executive Functioning (BRIEF) Teacher
Form

Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) Teacher and Parent Forms
Systematic Observation of On Task Behavior, Positive Interactions with
peers and Adults, Instances of Non-compliance

h. Student, Parent and School Personnel Interviews. (B14, p.1 of 30; Tr.
Board Psychologist, 5/30/13, p. 206)

Board Psychologist reviewed a 2008 psycho—educational evaluation of the Student
that was conducted by a neuropsychologist utilized by South Windsor Public
Schools) (B1) as pan of the comprehensive evaluation. He reviewed the Student
record including prior IEP’S, conducted interviews with current teachers; the
Student’s parents and the Student. Board Psychologist interviewed and observed
the Student in his home environment, his school environment and in interactions
with both peers and adults for a time period in excess of ﬁve hours. He spent two
Saturdays intewiewing the Parents as well as phone intewiews with the Student’s
mother. He interviewed the current school social worker, had a limited
conversation with Educational Consultant, also with the shop teacher and the
instructional assistant. (B14).

The Woodcock Johnson 111 Normative Update Tests of Cognitive Abilities and
Achievement (“W—J III”) is designed to determine an individual’s cognitive
processing, executive functioning, intellectual functioning and sequential
reasoning, among other areas. (Testimony, Tr. Board Psychologist, 5/30/13, pp.
43-48).

A summary of the analysis of the Student’s scores on the W—J HT is encapsulated
below:

a. General Intellectual ability is low average range.

b. Verbal Ability Score on the W—J III is solidly average and reﬂects
adequate language development demonstrated through understanding of
words and the relationship among words. His Verbal Comprehension and
General Information scores are within average limits.

C. Thinking Ability, comprised of visual—auditory learning, spatial relations,
sound blending and concept formation, is low average.

d. Cognitive efﬁciency, which provides an indication of automatic cognitive
processing and is evident from processing speed and shott—term verbal
memory, is below average.

e. Executive processes score, measuring aspects of executive functioning in
terms of planning, interference control or inhibition and ﬂexibility
mentally, is below average. While demonstrating adequate planning on a
pencil and paper systematic ﬁgure tracing task with minimal time
constraints, it is in the area of interference control or inhibition that he
falls well enough below average to pull his overall score below average.
(B14, pp. 7—12 of30).

The Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (“GARS”), which is normed on an autistic
population, is designed to assess social communication deﬁcits. (Testimony, Tr.
Board Psychologist, 5/30/13, pp. 48—50).

The GARS provides a sample of three domains that represent the primary features
ofAutism. (B14, pp. 13—15 0f30).

The Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (“ASDS”) is designed to assess
individuals on the autism spectrum in the areas of language skills, the social
domain, maladaptive behaviors, and cognitive proﬁle. (B14 p. 14, Testimony, Tr.
Board Psychologist, 5/30/13, pp. 54-58).

The Conners Rating Scale 3 Teacher’s Form (“Conners”) is designed to assess
attention issues in a variety of subareas. (B14 p.15; Testimony, Tr. Board
Psychologist, 5/30/13, p. 59).

The Conners is a rating scale that considers students levels of inattention,
hyperactivity/impulsivity, learning and executive functioning problems along with
possible difficulties in peer relations and aggression. (B14, p. 15 of 30).

The Student’s Conners observes a pattern of extreme difﬁculties with inattention
and only slightly less severe hyperactivity/impulsivity. He is seen as very often
arguing with adults, getting into trouble with teachers or the principal and acting
in a sneaky manipulative way. He is also seen as refusing to do what adults tell
him to do and not seeming sorry about misbehaving. He is cited as oﬁen veiy
often getting bored and often having a short attention, easily sidetracked, having
trouble concentrating, easily distracted, having trouble changing from one activity
to another and having trouble keeping his mind on work for long. He is often
seen as leaving his seat when he should stay seated, has difﬁculty waiting his turn,
ﬂdgets, and gets up and moves around during lessons. (B14, pp. 14—15 of 30).
The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning, Teacher Form
(“BRIEF”) is designed to measure one’s ability to regulate one’s behavior and
ability to engage in metacognition. (B14, pp, 16-17; Testimony, Tr. Board
Psychologist, 5/30/13, pp. 61-65).

Executive functioning entails the abilities to regulate behavior and to think about
and control our thinking or metacognition. Behavioral regulation at least includes
the abilities to inhibit responses, shift attention and thinking, to exert emotional
control and to monitor the effect of his behavior on others. Metacognition
includes the abilities to initiate or start thinking, to utilize working memory, to
plan and organize tasks, to organize materials and to monitor your work. (B14,
pp. 15-16 0130).

. The Student, rated by his special education teaclier\co-teacher, suggested overall
difﬁculties with executive functions skills. (B14, p.16 of 30)

Behavior Regulation is rated as having difﬁculty well above the average range
He is seen as oﬁen not thinking before doing, interrupting others, being
impulsive, not thinking of consequences before acting. (B14, p. 17 of 30).

The Student’s ability to shift his responses to solve problems or adapt his
responses is rated as a signiﬁcant problem area within school. He is rated as
having a high amount of problems with emotional control; moods change quickly
and seem to be easily inﬂuenced by the situation he is in and becoming too easily
upset. (B14, p.17 of30).

Within metacognition the Student is rated as having a severe level of problems, is
seen as not being a self—staiter, needs to be told when to begin tasks even when he
is willing, doesn’t show creativity when solving problems, has problems coming
up with different ways to solve a problem and has trouble starting on homework
or chores and does not take initiative. (B 14, p.17 of 30).

In the areas of Planning and organizing the Student often has trouble handing in
work, even when it is completed and is oveiwhelmed by large projects. He does
not plan ahead for assignments, gets caught up in the details and misses the big
picture, has good ideas but lacks follow through, underestimates time needed to
complete tasks, starts assignments at the last minute and written work is poorly
organized. (B14, p.17 of 30).

On the scale of Organizing Materials, teacher rated at the 97lh percentile, he is
seen as often losing things, disorganized backpack, and can’t seem to ﬁnd things
in his desk or room as his desk is messy. (B14, p.17 of 30).

Problems with monitoring his work and his impact on others are much greater
than his average peers. He often does not check for mistakes in his work, is
unaware how his behavior affects others, leaves work incomplete, doesn’t notice
when his behavior causes a negative reaction in others, talks too loudly and his
work is sloppy. (B14, 1). 17 of30).

Overall, his General Executive Composite falls at the 99'h percentile, which is the
highest range possible for these difﬁculties. (B 14, p.17 of 30).

The Social Skills Improvement Scale (“8818”) is designed to provide a broad
assessment of a student’s social behaviors which may affect student—teacher
relations, peer acceptance and academic performance. (B14, p. 17).

The Student is seen by his teacher and substitute\observe1' as using below average
social skills, with above average problem behaviors and demonstrating average
academic competence. (B14, p. 18 of 30).

The Student is seen as having speciﬁc strengths in communications for speaking
in appropriate tones and taking turns in conversation. A speciﬁc strength was also
identified within self-control for using appropriate language when upset. (B 1 4,

p. 18 of 30).

The teachers concerns show most in the areas of externalizing and internalizing
behaviors, through his frequent withdrawal from others, easy distraction and
having low energy or being lethargic; temper tantrums, inattention, disobeying
rules or requests, acting sad or depressed or lying 01' not telling the truth are often
observed. (B14, p.18 of 30).

The Student’s parents identiﬁed more positive strengths in the areas of
responsibility (respecting others property; engagement (starting conversations
with adults); self—control (responds appropriately when pushed or hit); asseﬂion
(stands up for others when treated unfairly); empathy (tries to comfort others and
shows concern for others); and cooperation (follows mIes when playing games).
(B14, p.20 of 30).

Areas of concern noted by the Parents seem to fall along the lines of skills that the
Student has learned and those that he has yet to learn. For those skills rated as
average for the Student, they were all within one to two points of the below
average range, or low average, and seemed to deal also with externalizing and
internalizing behaviors. (B14, p.20 of 30).

Board Psychologist answered the questions presented by the November, 201 l
PPT as follows:

a. How much time does [Student] spend on task? When is he off task,
what is he doing? Student is on task approximately 50% of the time.
When he is off task he is engaged in preferred activities such as occupying
himself with his phone, walking out of class, seeking suppoﬁ from the
school psychologist to resolve his daily and momentary concerns. He also
indulges in hypochondriacal complaints that he emphatically reports to the
school psychologist and requests his mother be contacted immediately so
he might receive medical attention. He can get locked in in his thinking
about situations and experience great difﬁculty shifting his responses to
move on from what is bothering him, which is very much related to his
autism. Multiple times when provided “two choices” he has declined to
act on either choice. Sometimes he appears over stimulated by the level of
activity around him and the demands of school, so he either avoids and/or
attempts to gain control by leaving the class or seeking to discuss his
perceived problems. He makes use of “sensory breaks” but appears to
have a very hard time getting back on track. (paraphrased) (1314, p.29 of
30).

b. What are the academic, social and emotional “triggers” to [Student’s]
off task behavior? A distinction needs to be made between fast/external
triggers and slow/intei‘nal triggers. Fast triggers would include immediate
antecedents to the identiﬁed target behaviors— teacher direct requests or
demands, peer comment, change of task. Slow triggers include setting
events or situations — medications, fatigue, diet, disabilities, routines, in-
orowds 01' when alone, etc. (B14, p.30 of 30).

c. What educational supports are needed to improve [Student’s] on task
behavior? [Student] was successful when he was supported in a self-
contained classroom for math and resource suppott along with a para or
instructional assistant in Science and Social Studies. An instructional
assistant seems to be strongly needed in this high school setting. Support
with realizing that he is capable on more difﬁcult tasks but needs to spend
greater efforts on easier ones. High need for external reminders and
would beneﬁt from being paired with a student who has strong focusing
ability, Placed in the least distracting setting to improve work completion.

12

October 11, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0321

Predictability and structured routines. Helping [Student] remember
requirements and standards for papers through standardizing formats
across settings; providing visual examples; attacking long-term or
complex assignments by showing him how to use a calendar, syllabus or
schedule; help with setting intermediate goals, discover and enforce best
study schedule; handling multiple steps in procedures with graphic
organizers and procedure sheets, teaching memory strategies. Use of oral
testing when feasible. To foster more independent work by [Student]
maintain on—task behavior through use of verbal cues, use of interesting
tasks, use interactive tasks for drill and rote, keep tasks brief, allow for
breaks; improve time management by setting intermediate goals, offering
frequent feedback; emphasize accuracy over quantity; enhance awareness
of relevant information by previewing materials, using highlighter to note
critical features, show how to cross out unimportant information; handle
assignments with multiple objectives by simplifying assignments, focus on
a few objectives rather than all of them, make objectives clear; respond to
increasing reading and writing demands by providing procedure sheets
and providing examples. (paraphrased) (B14, p.28 of 30).

d. How does [Student’s] emotional functioning and social awareness
impact [Student’s] academic, social performance in school? As
[Student] himself is well aware, his PDD NOS greatly impacts his abilities
to understand and work cooperatively with others. [Student] is
experiencing developmental inunaturities that diminish his capacity to
perform and produce at the level of the average student his age. However
he is quite capable intellectually when what is presented to him is tailored
to his needs in a very individualized manner. The Student’s General
intellectual Ability is in the low average range. (B14, pp.7, 30 of 30).

e. What recommendations are suggested for the school and family to
support [Student's] academic, social and emotional growth? There is
little doubt [Student] needs a smaller, closed educational setting that has
predictability and consistency. All of the detailed recommendations
regarding improving his executive functioning and social skills are
needed. [Student’s] disabilities are production disabilities. Both his
autism and ADHD inhibit his performance of the work and organizational
demands of high school. He is overwhelmed by traditional high school
requirements; he needs modiﬁcation in curriculum and instructional
strategies to succeed. (paraphrased) (B14, p.30 0f 30).

68. The Parents received a copy of the Board Psychologist repon on January 24,
2013. (Testimony, Tr. 6/7/2013, Father, p.38). The Board scheduled a PPT
meeting to discuss the Board Psychologist report for January 28, 2013. (B20, p.1
0f 9)

69. The Parents requested and were granted a delay in the PPT, with a new scheduled
date of February 14, 2013 by mutual agreement. (Testimony, Tr. 6/7/2013, Father,
pp. 3940, Educational Consultant, 8/7/2013 p. 162).

70. Father then requested a postponement of the PPT meeting, via email dated
2/ 14/2013, citing an emergency work situation that he was unable to get out 01‘.

(P16, p.2; Testimony, Tr. 6/6/2013, Father, pp. 70—72, 122—123). Father is
employed with a steel corporation in Bettendorf, Iowa, where his job duties are
located. (Testimony, Tr. 6/6/2013, Father, p.16).

The Board received the email requesting the postponement of the PPT meeting on
the morning of 2/ 14/20133 . (Testimony, Tr. 5/31/2013, Educational Consultant,
pp. 53—55).

The Board held the PPT meeting on 2/14/2013, with Mother present, and with the
Parents choosing to not allow the Student to patticipate. (Testimony, Tr.
8/7/2013, Educational Consultant, p. 160, 167; School Psychologist, 8/6/2013,
p.70—71; Special Education Department Chair, 8/7/2013, p.32; B15).

After a review of the comprehensive evaluation conducted by Board Psychologist
and discussion by the participants, the PPT, with clear opposition ﬁ‘om Mother,
concluded that the Student’s needs could not be met at Cheney Tech and that the
Student should be returned to his LEA, South Windsor for programming and
placement purposes, pursuant to C.G.S. §10-76q. (Testimony, Tr. 8/7/13, Special
Education Chair, pp. 33-34; School Psychologist, 8/6/2013, pp. 70—71;
Educational Consultant, 8/7/2013, pp. 162-168; B15, p. 3 M4).

The minutes of the PPT indicate that the Parent requested an IEE because she
disagreed with the Board Psychologist evaluation; an explanation of the
requirements for requesting an IEE was also discussed by Educational Consultant.
(B 1 5).

The PPT minutes document the consensus that the Student was failing all core
academic classes, and that his behavior was unacceptable in that his time on task
was on average, 50%. (B15, p.3 0f 4).

The Parents subsequently invoked stay-put and rejected the IEP, (B15, p.3 of 4).
The Parents ﬁled for a due process hearing on 2/20/2013, amending their
complaint on 2/22/2013. (P1; P2).

The Board ﬁled on 2/22/20] 3, for a due process hearing regarding the issue of the
appropriateness of their comprehensive evaluation, and the Parents request for an
IEE. (11.0.1).

The Board held a PPT meeting on 4/24/2013. The Parents participated, with
Father palticipating by telephone. The Board reiterated its decision that the
Student be returned to his sending LEA, in addition to suggestions to provide
services to the Student in the interim that were in keeping with that decision; the
Parents reiterated their rejection of that proposal and their continuing demand that
stay-put be continued pending the outcome of the due process hearing.

The Board held a PPT meeting on 5/17/2013. The Parents were not in attendance.
having made a request to have the meeting scheduled through their legal counsel
as a due process complaint had been ﬁled. The Parties disagree as to if that
request for a meeting was scheduled through the Parents counsel. (B18, p.7 019).
Disciplinary data maintained by the Board showed signiﬁcant behavioral deﬁance
by Student over the course of his enrollment at Cheney Tech. There was one
incident of the Student refusing to hand over a piece of metal he was sharpening

3 11 is unclear by the email referenced, ifFather would have physically been at the PPT meeting or would
have panicipated via speakelphone, which he had done in the past.

into a tool for his father without teacher permission. After repeated requests, the
Student handed the tool to one of the teachers. (B27, pp.1—6)
The 5/17/2013 PPT recommended a therapeutic day placement during the
pendency of the due process complaint, following self—harming statements made
by the Student, which were reported to the Parents. (B 1 8, p.7 of 9).
Statements had been made by the Student, both in and out of school, utilizing the
term “suicide” which caused the Board concern and the Parents to request an
evaluation by his therapist. (Testimony, Tr. 6/3/2013, Therapist, pp. 29—31),
Therapist stated that in his professional opinion the “suicidal” incidents were
ideation on the pint of the Student and that he was not a danger to either himself
or others, and that similar statements and behaviors had been made years ago as
repelted by another therapist. (Testimony, Tr. 6/3/2013, Therapist, pp. 46-51).
Therapist opined that the Student has emotional reactions to academic demands
when he’s getting either fatigued 0r frustrated. (Testimony, Tr. 6/3/2013,
Therapist, pp. 55-56).
The Parents further amended their complaint on the record, with consent from the
Board, on 6/3/2013 (one of the hearing dates), to include three additional hearing
issues: (Testimony, Tr. 6/3/2013, Counsel for Parties)
i. The appropriateness of the IEP for the 2013—2014 school year;
ii. The PPT decision to recommend a therapeutic day treatment
program at the 5/17/2013 PPT meeting;
iii. The decision to hold the 5/17/20] 3 PPT meeting without the
Parents

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DISCUSSION:

1.

The Parties, individually, have brought this action in accordance with the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act which provides for special education
and related services to children with disabilities, from birth through age 21. It is
undisputed that the Student is entitled to receive a free and appropriate education
(“FAPE”) with special education and related sewices under the disability category
“Autism”, pursuant to state and federal laws. E C.G.S. §§ 10-76 er. seq; the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1401 el. seq.

The standard for determining whether FAPE has been provided is set forth in
Rowley, supra. The two pronged inquiry is ﬁrst, whether the procedural
requirements of IDEA have been met and second, whether the IEP is “reasonably
calculated to enable the child to receive educational beneﬁts.” Board of
Education ofthe Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley, 458 US.
176, 206—207 (1982). The Supreme Court has made clear that “appropriate”
under the IDEA does not require that the school districts “maximize the potential
of handicapped children.” Wa/czak v. Florida Union Free School Dislricl, 142
F.3d 199, 130 (2d Cir. 1998), citing Rowley, supra. Rather, school districts are
required to provide, as the “basic ﬂoor of oppoﬁunity access to specialized
services which are individually designed to provide educational beneﬁt to the
handicapped child.” Rowley, supra, 458 US. at 201; see also KP, v. Jz/zwic, 891

15

October 1 1, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0321

F. Supp. 703, 718 (D. Conn. 1995) (Goal of IDEA is to provide access to public
education for disabled students, not to maximize a special education child’s
potential). In this Circuit, the Court of Appeals has said that the proper gauge for
determining educational progress is “whether the educational program provided
for a child is reasonably calculated to allow the child to receive “meaningful”
educational beneﬁts.” Ms. B. v. Milford Board of Education, 103 F. 3d 1 114, 1120
(2d. Cir. 1997).

3. The Count of Appeals has also cautioned the meaningful educational beneﬁts are
“not everything that might be thought desirable by loving parents.” Tucker v. Bay
Shore Union Free School Dist., 873 F.2d 563, 567 (2d Cir. 1989). “Of course, a
child’s academic progress must be viewed in light of the limitations imposed by
the child’s disability.” Ms, B. v. Milford, supra at l 121. When determining the
appropriateness of a given placement courts will also consider evidence of a
student’s progress in that placement. The student’s capabilities, intellectual
progress and what the LEA has offered must be considered along with grade
promotions and test scores in determining whether the program offered is
reasonably calculated to confer a nontrivial or meaningful educational beneﬁt to
the child. See. Hall v. Vance County Bd. ofEd. 774 F.2d 629, 635 (1985).

4. The cases where procedural Violations have been found to constitute a denial of a
free appropriate public education have involved misinforming parents of their
rights under IDEA, and/or signiﬁcantly inhibiting them from meaningful
participation in the development of an IEP. See, e.g., Briere v. Fair Haven Grade
School District, 948 F. Supp. 1242 (D. Vt. 1996); Hall v. Vance Co. Bd. ofEduc.,
774 F.2d 629, 635 (4th Cir. 1985).

Is the Board’s comprehensive educational evaluation completed over November 29,
2012 through January 13, 2013, appropriate for this Student?

5. The Parents did not accept the Board’s comprehensive evaluation and requested
an IEE, to be paid at public expense, pursuant to 34 C.F.R. §§300.502 (20(1) and
300.103(b)(1). The Board, acting pursuant to §300.103(b)(2)(i), promptly ﬁled a
request for a due process hearing on the premise that their evaluation, conducted
by the Board’s evaluator, between the dates of November, 2012 and January,
2013, was appropriate.

6. The IDEA 2004 requires that local education agencies (“LEA”) “not use any
single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child
is a child with a disability or determining an appropriate educational program for
the child." 20 U.S.C.A. § l4l4(b)(2)(B) (2008). It is also required that the local
educational agency "use technically sound instruments that may assess the
relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical or
developmental factors." 20 U.S.C.A. § l4l4(b)(2)(C) (2008) (emphasis added).
Blake B., and Jack and Yvonne B., v. Council Rock School District, 51 IDELR
100, 108 LRP 58171. The court also requires that "assessments and other
evaluation materials used to assess a child are used for purposes for which the
assessments or measures are valid and reliable," and "are administered in

16

October 11, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13-0321

accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of such assessments.
20 U.S.C. § 14l4(b)(3)(A) (2008) (emphasis added). 1d. 34 CFR
§300.304(c)(1)(iv) requires that assessments and other evaluation materials used
to assess a child under this part “are administered by trained and knowledgeable
personnel; . .”

“In determining the standard of appropriateness of an evaluation, the focus is on
whether the evaluation (1) used a variety of essential tools; (2) was administered
by trained, knowledgeable and qualiﬁed personnel; (3) was administered under
the standard conditions and in accordance with instructions provided by the
producer of the assessments; (4) incorporated various information sources such as
classroom observations and review of existing data; and (5) whether the
independent information would provide any new information.” Westpor'l Board
ofEducation v. Student, Final Decision and Order 1 1—0355,(CT 201 1), citing
Warren G. u Cumberland County School District, 190 F.3d 80, 87 (3'd Cir 1999);
34 CFR §300.502.

7. The Board’s evaluator has a PhD. in Educational Psychology (T estimony, Tr.
5/30/2013, Board Psychologist, p.35). Board Psychologist is celtiﬁed by the
Connecticut State Department of Education as a school psychologist. (B 1 6). He
has 25 years of experience in school psychology (Testimony, Tr. 5/30/2013,
Board Psychologist, p.27). His experiences range from working as a direct line
staff with people with disabilities, including those along the autism spectrum, to
becoming more directly responsible for the evaluation of students as he
progressed in his academic and employment career. (Id, pp 28 — 34) He has
conducted hundreds of evaluations of students over the course of his career.
(Testimony, Tr. 5/30/2013, Board Psychologist, p. 67). The regulatory
requirement that the evaluator be a “trained and knowledgeable personnel” has
been met.

8. The following components made up the evaluation given by Board Psychologist
(B 14):
a. Woodcock—Johnson HI Normative Update Tests of Cognitive Abilities
and Achievement;
Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS)
Asperger Syndrome Rating Diagnostic Scale (ASDS)
Connors Rating Scale 3 Teacher Form
Behavior Rating Inventmy of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) Teacher
F orm
Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) Teacher and Parent Forms
Systematic Observation of On Task Behavior, Positive Interactions
with peers and Adults, Instances of Non—compliance
ht Student, Parent and School Personnel Interviews
9. Testimony given by the Board Psychologist, which was not reﬁtted by the
Parents expert, indicated that the assessments used were normed. In some
instances, the assessment was speciﬁcally normed with the diagnostic categmy
and more relevant for use with this palticular Student. (Testimony, Tr. 5/30/13,

Board Psychologist, pp. 43—50) No testimony or evidence was offered which
suggested 01' indicated that the assessments used were not administered in the
fashion from which they were intended to be administered, in accordance with 20
U.S.C. § 1414(b)(3)(A).

The requirement to incorporate various other sources of information was met, as
the Board Psychologist testiﬁed that he reviewed all records that were provided to
him, speciﬁcally IEP’s, any prior evaluations that had been completed, data
information collected by the Board, interviews with staff and parents, including
information provided by the Parents from earlier in middle school. (Testimony,
Tr. 5/30/2013, Board Psychologist, pp. 42—70).

The Parents argue that the Board’s evaluation fails on a number of levels. (Parents
Proposed Findings of Fact, pg.l 1-13, No.’s 30 _ 32). First, the Parents do not
accept the abilities of the evaluator as being sufﬁcient to conduct and interpret a
comprehensive evaluation for their child. For all of the reasons stated above
referencing the requirements for properly conducting an evaluation, the Parents
argument fails. Secondly the Parents argue that the evaluator did not conduct an
analysis of the Student’s freshman year at Cheney Tech. (Parents Proposed

F indings of Fact, p.1 1, No.31). The evaluator reviewed evaluations from as far
back as 2008, all of the IEP’s for this student, inclusive of the ﬁrst IEP written for
this Student prior to entering Cheney Tech, his eighth grade educational
assessment, the annual IEP conducted during the freshman year and subsequent
IEP’S created since that time. (B14). Given that the freshman year review would
have been retrospective at the time of the Board Psychologist’s evaluation, there
would be negligible information that would have been helpful that was not
covered in all of the data provided up to the freshman year annual review.

The Parents also dismiss the responses given by the Board Psychologist to the
questions posed by the PPT for him when evaluating the Student. (Parents
Proposed F indings of Fact, p. 1 2—13). I ﬁnd that the Parents perspective of the
responses are in direct contradiction to the actual information contained within the
evaluation itself, in which the Board Psychologist responds to each question
directly, though not in the same order. (B14, pp. 14-30; Findings of Fact No. 68).
As the information describing that analysis is provided in the ﬁnding of facts, 1
will not replicate it here.

The Parents argue that the evaluator did not directly observe enough of the
emotions or behaviors that may have affected the Student’s performance; however
the Parents provide no legal argument that such long term, intensive observation
is required. The evaluator utilized a wide variety of data sources, all of which are
identiﬁed in his comprehensive evaluation, all of which meet the statutory and
regulatory requirements oleEA. 20 U.S.CA. § 1414(b)(2)(C) (2008). That the
evaluator’s conclusions are different from those of the expert that the Parents
hired to review his evaluation does not make the evaluation any less appropriate.

An independent educational evaluation “is an evaluation conducted by a qualiﬁed
examiner who is not employed by the district responsible for the child's
education.” 34 CFR 300.502 (a)(3)(i).

15. The Parents utilized the sewices of a skilled and knowledgeable expett, in their
quest to obtain the best services for their child, who did not work for the district.
(P19). He did not, however, conduct an IEE of the Student. He did provide the
Parents with a Consultative Report, in which he rightly or wrongly critiques the
evaluation and evaluative process of the Board’s evaluator. (P18). There are
critiques and examinations of information that was gathered by prior evaluators;
limited direct obsewation of the Student (2 days), an historical review of the
record, intewiews with stakeholders, and a review of the data collected by the
Board concerning behaviors, but there are no new assessments or evaluations
given directly to the Student by the Parents expert. (P18) The critique of the
information regarding the implementation of the Student’s BIP, could be quite
useful, but in and of itself, does not satisfy the overall requirement that the IEE
(1) used a variety Qfessenlia/ tools; (2) was administered by trained,
knowledgeable and qualiﬁed personnel; (3) was adminis/ered under the standard
conditions and in accordance with instructions provided by the producer oflhe
assessments; (4) incorporated various information sources such as classroom
observations and review of existing data; and (5) whether the independenl
information would provide any new ily’ormation. ” (emphasis added) Westport
Board of Education V. Student, Final Decision and Order 11—0355,(CT 2011),
citing Warren G. v. Cumberland County School District, 190 F.3d 80, 87 (3rd Cir
1999); 34 CFR §300.502. With the exception of the critiquing information, which
may or may not be valid, there is minimal new educational information (transition
planning) about the Student that has been garnered through this Consultative
Report that was not already provided in the Board’s comprehensive evaluation.
(P18), The area in which this Consultative Repott could have outshined the
Board’s evaluation would have been if speciﬁc evaluations relative to transitional
planning had been conducted and the results incorporated into future lEP
plamling. Unfortunately, no such evaluations were conducted.

16. A Parents disagreement with the results of an evaluation, without more, does not
render that evaluation inappropriate. See Rowland Uniﬁed Sch. Dist, 110 LRP

appropriate based upon the elements of the assessments used pursuant to
applicable law) See also Blake B. by Jack and Yvonne B. v. Council Rock Sch.

The ﬁrst prong of the two-pronged standard for determining whether the Board
offered the Student an appropriate IEP for the 201 1-2012 and 2012-2013 school
years concerns whether the procedural requirements of IDEA have been met.
Board ofEducation of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley,
458 US. 176, 206-207 (1982). “In matters alleging a procedural violation, a
hearing ofﬁcer may ﬁnd that a child did not receive a FAPE only if the procedural
inadequacies——— (i) Impeded the child’s right to a FAPE; (ii) Signiﬁcantly impeded
the Parents opportunity to participate in the decision-makjng process regarding
the provision of a FAPE to the Parents child; or (iii) Caused a deprivation of
educational beneﬁt.” 34 C.F.R. §300.513(a)(2).

No evidence was presented that the Board altered or failed its usual procedure to
develop an IEP for a child with a disability. (Findings of Fact No. 8). The
Parents and the Student were active palticipants in the formation of the 5/ 5/ 1 1 IEP
(initial Cheney Tech IEP), no evidence was presented that indicated that they
were denied panicipation in the PPT meeting. (Findings of Fact No.’s 10, 1 1, 12,
13). The Parents accepted the IEP after it was created. (Findings of Fact N0. 14).
The Parents argue additionally that the IEP for the year2011-2012 was
inappropriate because the BIP was inappropriate. The Parents argue that the goals
and objectives that would relate to his behaviors and transition issues were not
appropriate which contributed to the Student ﬂunking one course and was close to
ﬂunking ﬁve others.

The initial Cheney Tech IEP was created at a joint meeting with the Parents,
Cheney Tech and the sending LEA, South Windsor Public Schools on 5/5/2011.
(Findings of Fact No. 8). The resulting IEP mirrored the South Windsor IEP in
effect, in most respects, with the exception of the 5/5/20] 1 IEP indicating clearly
that the Student has issues with depression, withdrawal, study skills and
functional communication scales. The Student was ﬁuther identiﬁed as being at
risk clinically for signiﬁcant depression and behavioral symptoms. (F indings of
Fact No. 14; B6). The South Windsor Special Education teacher noted that the
Student had made progress behaviorally and socially since the 6lh grade. (Finding
of Fact No.9). There was no evidence produced that indicated that the Parents
objected to the goals or objectives of the proposed IEP prior to the start of the

201 1—2012 school year.

C.F.R. §300.324(2)(i) states, in relevant part, “in the case ofa child whose
behavior impedes the child’s learning or that of others, consider the use of
behavioral intewentions and suppotts, and other strategies, to address that
behavior.”

The BIP, though not formally written as a separate document was described in the
Planning and Placement Team Meeting Summary portion of the IEP. (B6, p.2 of
23).

On 10/7/201 1, one month after the start of the school year, a PPT meeting was
held to create a formalized BIP. (Findings of Fact N0. 15). The Board utilized its
school psychologist to conduct a functional behavioral assessment in the creating
of the BIP. (Findings of Fact No. 16). The BIP identiﬁed three target behaviors,
and claimed that the function of the maladaptive behaviors by the Student was to
attempt to control his environment. (Findings ofFact No. 17, 18).

Subsequent progress reports indicated that the Student was receiving
unsatisfactory progress on two of the three goals contained in the 5/3/11 IEP.
(Findings of Fact N0. 22)

On 5/3/2012, the Board held the annual PPT for the Student, where the IEP for
the 2012—2013 school years was developed, at the time of the PPT meeting the
Student was in jeopardy of failing the core subjects of English, Algebra and
Global Studies. (B9, p.2) The BIP was modiﬁed slightly to have tasks presented
in small chunks to the Student. (P23, p.4).

The Student achieved passing grades for the 201 1-2012 school years, with the
exception of failing Global Studies, a core subject. (F indings of Fact No. 22).
The PPT continued the same level of academic suppOIt for the 2012-2013 school
year that was provided during the 201 1—2012 school year — strategic tutoring
twice per academic week, co—taught English, Math, Social Studies and Science at
least two periods each class per academic week, counseling with the school
psychologist .5 hours per week and implementation of a behavior intervention
plan. (F indings of Fact N01 26).

The Board held two additional PPT meetings to address concerns by the Parents;
the ﬁrst on 6/1 1/2012 in which the Board agreed to meet with all staff prior to the
start of the new school year to review the 5/3/2012 IEP, the BIP, and to identify
signs of frustration from the Student and how to work with him. All of the
Parental requests were incorporated into the resulting IEP with the exception of
the request to have the school write down or email the Student’s homework to the
Parents. (B10, p.2 0f 4); The PPT met again on 8/28/2012 where the Student and
his mother met the Student’s teachers, to provide the regular education teachers
the IEP and BIP. The BIP was reviewed by the special education teacher and the
school psychologist. All were advised of the issue of encopresis, and informed
that the Parents welcomed frequent feedback Via email. (B12, p.2 of 3).

A PPT meeting was held on 11/1/2012 where it was agreed by the team that an
evaluation would be performed, the questions for that evaluation were formulated,
a process to gather data was established and to review the BIP. (B12, Testimony,
Tr. 8/7/2013, Educational Consultant, pp. 153—154; 8/6/2013, School
Psychologist, pp.57-58; Findings of Fact N0.’s 36—40).

The Board conducted a comprehensive evaluation between November, 2012 and
January, 2013. (Findings of Fact No. 41). The Board scheduled a PPT meeting
for 1/28/2013 to review the evaluation. (Findings of Fact N0. 71), rescheduled the
meeting as requested by the Parents to 2/ 14/2013 (Findings of Fact N0. 72),
received a request to postpone the PPT meeting 011 2/ 14/2013 (sent on 2/13/2013)
(F indings of Fact No. 73) and subsequently denied the request to postpone and
held the PPT meeting on 2/14/2013 with Mother present. (Finding of Fact No.76).

. The PPT participants, with exception of the Parents, determined that the Student’s

needs precluded the ability of Cheney Tech to meet his needs and that he should
be returned to his sending LEA, pursuant to C.G.S. §10-76q. (Findings of Fact
No. 77).

. 1 ﬁnd that the Board committed no procedural Violations for the 201 1-2012, or the

initial 2012—2013 IEP. “Only procedural inadequacies that cause substantial harm
to the child or his parents ~ meaning that the individual or cumulative result is the

loss of educational opportunity or seriously infringe on a Parents participation in
the creation or formulation of the IEP — constitute a denial of FAPE.” Mairejek v,
Brewsler Cent. Sch. Dist. 471 F. Supp. 415, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). There simply
is no showing that a substantial harm was caused to this student or a Parents
participation in the 5/5/1 1 or 5/3/12 PPT meetings due to procedural violations.
The second prong 0f the Rowley inquiry requires a ﬁnding that the IEP is
“reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational beneﬁts.” Board
ofEducaIion v. Rowley, supra, 206-207. The court stated, in J.R. v. Bd afEducl of
City of Rye Sch. Dist. “011 review, hearing ofﬁcer or court should consider
whether the IEP was designed to confer beneﬁt at the time it was created.” 35
F.Supp. 2d 386 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)

In regards to the 201 1-2012 academic years, for the reasons elucidated in No.’s
21—25, supra, I ﬁnd that the IEP was reasonably calculated to enable the Student
to achieve educational beneﬁts. The Board had no reason to believe that the
Student would not have been successful academically, behaviorally or socially
based on the report of success from South Windsor over the previous two years.
The initial IEP (5/5/201 1) was tailored on a successful IEP from the sending LEA,
the Board responded quickly when the Parents raised concerns about behavioral
issues and created a formalized separate BIP. In the initial formulation of the
IEP, prior to the comprehensive evaluation done by the Board Psychologist in
11/2012, the Board was operating on the most recent information gleaned from
the most recent provider (Timothy Edwards Middle School) Which indicated that
the Student had success academically and behaviorally. (F indings of Fact No. 9).
In D.F. ex rel. N.F. v Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist, 430 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2005)
the court noted decisions from other circuits holding “that inquiry into whether an
IEP is valid is a necessarily prospective analysis”, See e.g. F uhl'man v. East
Hanover Board quducation, 993 F .2d. 1031, 1040 (3rd Cir. (1993) (“measure
and adequacy of an IEP can only be determined as of the time it is offered to the
student and not at some later time”).

I ﬁnd that there were no procedural violations sufﬁcient to deny the Student a
FAPE for the IEP 2012—2013 school years in relation to the IEP’s dated 5/3/12;
6/11/12; 8/28/12 or 11/1/12. For all ofthe reasons noted supra in No.’s 24-28, the
Parents and the Student were afforded every opportunity to participate and assist
in the creation of the IEP’s. No evidence was presented that the Board denied or
delayed the scheduling of any request for a PPT that the Parents made. The
Parents were afforded every opportunity to provide information, they did not ask
for any evaluation (prior to the request for an 11313) that was denied.

In regards to the 2/14/2014 PPT meeting, the Parent claims a procedural issue
arose because Father had requested a postponement until 2/28/ 14 due to an
emergent situation at work in Iowa that he would not be able to paiticipate in any
fashion on the 14m. (Findings of Fact No’s 73—75). The Board held the meeting as
scheduled, which was a previously re-scheduled meeting in which the new date
was selected by both parties, and in which Father was in attendance. (Findings of
Fact, No. 76). It is clear from all of the record that both Parents have been active
participants in all of the PPT meetings for their son from his onset into the public
school system. It is also clear from the minutes of the IEP’s that Father has

22

39.

40.

41,

42.

participated via teleconference on more than one occurrence due to his work
location, In terms ofcollaboration, in terms of fulﬁlling the ultimate goal of
IDEA to encourage parental participation, it would have been well within the
Board’s power to agree to a postponement, even if a bit inconvenient to the
schedules of the participants. The Board however was under no obligation to
postpone the meeting given that at least one parent was going to be present.
C.F.R. §300.322(a) states in relevant part “ each public agency must take steps to
ensure that one or both parents of a child with a disability are present at each IEP
Team meeting or are afforded an oppomlnity to attend, and..” (Emphasis added)
C.G.S. §10-76d-12(c) requires, in relevant part, that the Board assure that “one or
both of the child’s parents are afforded the opportunity to participate in the
meetings. . .” and ﬁuther “every effoﬁ shall be made to schedule meetings at a
mutually agreed time and place. .1” The Board scheduled the meeting at a
mutually agreed upon time and place when it set the meeting for 2/14/2014.
Mother was able to attend the meeting; she is one of the parents of the Student,
and one who has also been at every PPT meeting held for the Student, as is
evident in the record. That Father could not participate, as he had in many other
situations, inclusive of the due process hearings, was not at the doings of the
Board, but rather an emergent work situation that the Board was not legally
responsible to make accommodations for,

I ﬁnd that there was no procedural violation sufﬁcient to deny the Student a FAPE
on the part of the Board for holding the 2/ 14/2014 PPT meeting with only one
Parent present.

I find no procedural violation sufficient to deny the Student a FAPE on the pan of
the Board for the 4/24/2013 PPT meeting and subsequent development of the IEP,
for all of the reasons previously cited.

I do ﬁnd a procedural violation sufficient to deny the Student a FAPE on the part
of the Board for the 5/7/2013 PPT meeting and the resultant IEP that was
developed. As stated previously in No. 36, C.F.R. 300.322 requires that the
public agency make reasonable attempts to allow one or both of the Parents to
palticipate in the meeting. The Parents made it clear to the Board that given that
due process had been initiated; they wanted all meetings to be scheduled through
their attorney. (P22). The Board offered no evidence that (1) it attempted to
comply with that directive and contact counsel for the Parents; and/or (2) that
those attempts were unsuccessful. By holding the 5/7/2013 meeting without the
Parents, the Parents were denied any meaningful participation in the creation of
their child’s IEP. The Board argument, cited in the post hearing brief on pg.28,
that there was no harm to the Student because nothing in the IEP changed as a
result of the 5/ 17/2013 meeting fails to consider that the harm was in the act of
denying meaningﬁxl participation, speciﬁcally what §300.322 seeks to address.
The regulation does not require that any change, large or small, occur before
parents are required to be allowed the opportunity to participate, it is clear that the
very act of having the meeting requires the opportunity to participate.

In regards to the second prong of the Rowley two prong test; I ﬁnd that there was
a substantive Violation sufﬁcient to deny the Student a FAPE, commencing with
the 5/3/2012 IEP. This IEP is essentially identical to the 5/5/1 l IEP despite the

23

44.

academic (the Student was ﬂunking virtually all of his classes) and behavioral
(signiﬁcant acts of deﬁance, sleeping in class, walking out of class, refusing to do
homework) issues dealt with over the preceding year. (B6, B9). Changes to the
BIP are negligible and fail to address in sufﬁcient detail what behaviors are being
addressed 01‘ how they will be signiﬁcantly altered. In fact it appears the only
change was to add the statement “[Student] may become easily overwhelmed and
function better when tasks are presented in small “chunks.” (P23, p.3). There is
no strategy or direction on how that (chunking) was to occur, or how to identify
the behavior if it occurs. There was no evidence submitted that any of the
behaviors addressed in the BIP were affected by the application of the BIP at all,
or that the Board would be able to show any evidence it could determine, either
positively or negatively, that the behaviors were affected or what the known
frequency of any of the behaviors were. This renders the BIP essentially useless
as a behavioral tool and as such deprives the Student of any educational beneﬁt
that a properly designed and executed BIP would be expected to render in
allowing the Student to attend to academic work. None of the subsequent
revisions to the BIP alter those facts, they simply continue the use of a faulty tool,
with meaningless revisions that do not address speciﬁc behaviors in a meaningful
way or allow any of the parties to assess the effectiveness of the interventions.
(P23, pp. 3~12).

The Board as much acknowledged that the 2012—2013 program for the Student
had been inappropriate when during the testimony of the Special Education
Consultant she responded to a direct question from the Board’s counsel, if anyone
at the 4/24/2013 PPT meeting thought the 2012—2013 program for the Student at
that point was appropriate, to which the witness responded “Well, N0. No, No”
(Testimony, Tr. 8/7/2013, Educational Consultant, p.186). While the response
was retrospective in nature, it outlined the reality of the IEP from the beginning.
Between the 5/3/2012 and 4/24/2013 PPT meetings, and the additional modiﬁed
lBP’s generated, 311011 of the Board decision to remove the Student pursuant to
§10-76q, there were no meaningful changes to the program or services offered to
the Student. (B8,9,10,11,12,13,15). The 5/3/2012 program was substantially the
same as the original IEP offered to the Student the previous year. Given that the
Board was aware that the Student had struggled the entire year, was not being
successful with the BIP, was at risk for failing most core subjects, the Board
should have made meaningful changes to both the BIP and the IEP to meet the
unique needs of the Student.

The Board failed to offer evidence which showed that the Board’s staff
implemented the BIP in the manner for which it was designed. In reality the data
collected by the Board regarding the targeted behaviors indicated that the
behavioral interventions did not decrease the behaviors, but rather showed an
increase in the behaviors. (P12; P13). Interviews conducted by the Parents expert
with Board staff suggest that there was signiﬁcant confusion over what speciﬁc
steps were to be taken to address targeted behaviors, what speciﬁc behaviors were
to be targeted, how those behaviors were to be identified, or if those interventions
were successful or not. The expert obsewed a failure of the staff to properly
implement the BIP on a consistent basis. (P18, pp.17, 23—24 of 29).

24

October 11, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13~0321

Does the program offered by the Board for the 2013-2014 school years offer the
Student a FAPE?

45.

46.

The 5/ 17/2013 IEP does not offer the Student a FAPE in the least restrictive
environment, nor does it offer an appropriate program and services for the
Student. The Board Offers a therapeutic day treatment program for the Student.
(B l 8, p.7 of 9). The Board has the burden of proof for proving the
appropriateness of the Student’s program or placement, which must be met by a
preponderance of the evidence. R.S.C.A. §10-76h-14(a); P, es rel, Mr, P. v.
Newington Bd. QfEdllC., 512 F.Supp.2d 89, 99 (D.Conn. 2007). The Board fails
to do so, despite the alleged concerns for the safety of the Student following the
suicidal ideation that was presented. The therapist for the Student, who had
worked with the Student for over a year, testiﬁed that he did not ﬁnd the Student
to be at a risk to himself or others, and that this was not new behavior for the
Student as similar behavior had been noted by a former evaluator and appeared to
be a stress behavior as opposed to an actual threat. (Testimony, Tr. 6/3/2013,
Therapist, pp.44—48). This same therapist has extensive knowledge of therapeutic
day treatment programs and felt that the Student was an inappropriate candidate
for them due to the lack of severity of his psychiatric needs. (Id. ). 34 CPR.
§300.1 16 requires placement of the Student in the least restrictive environment,
The Board failed to provide any other evidence which suggested 01‘ indicated that
the restrictive environment of a therapeutic day treatment program was warranted,
I ﬁnd that the program and services offered in the 5/ 17/2013 IEP are insufﬁcient
to allow the Student to obtain any meaningful educational beneﬁt per the
requirements of the Rowley coult. The services and program offered in the
5/17/2013 IEP consist of daily tutoring for up to 4 hours per day while awaiting
placement, plus ten (10) counseling sessions with a therapist of the families
choosing, with additional services to be decided after the 10 sessions are
exhausted. (B19, p.7 0f 9). Viltually none of the recommendations by the
Board’s evaluator were incorporated into the IEP (utilizing smaller less elaborate
settings; use of an instructional assistant; a method to monitor and promote
successful interactions with peers; engagement in sensory breaks; he1p connecting
with assigmnents; having the BIP make a clear distinction between fast/extemal
triggers and slow/internal triggers; providing predictable, consistent and
enforceable limits). (B14, pp. 27-30).

Does the Hearing Ofﬁcer have jurisdiction to address an alleged discriminatory
action by the Board by failing to provide supplementary aids, services, and
modiﬁcations to the curriculum to allow the Student to fully participate in the
placement programs, in violation of 29 U.S.C. §794 Nondiscrimination under
Federal Grants and Programs?

47‘

Not The Hearing Ofﬁcer does not have jurisdiction to address discriminatory
actions in Violation of U.S.C. §794 Nondiscrimination under Federal Grants and
Programs.

Did the Board improperly apply Connecticut General Statute (“C.G.S.”) §10-76q(c)
by expelling/discharging the Student from Howell Cheney Tech without ﬁrst

The Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies governs the regulations
concerning children entitled to receive special education services within the State
of Connecticut. Speciﬁcally, RCSA §10—76a deals with General deﬁnitions.
§10-76a (2) “Board of education” is deﬁned in relevant part as “. .. a public body
or public agency responsible for the education of children The term shall include
but not be limited to regional vocational—teclmical schools. . .”

Cheney Tech is a regional vocational—technical school located within the
geographical conﬁnes of the State of Connecticut. (Findings of Fact No. 6).
§10-76a also deﬁnes, in relevant part, “a child requiring special education” as
meaning “any exceptional child who ...(1) who meets the criteria for eligibility
for special education pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,
20 U.S.C. 1400, et seq., ...” The Student meets that eligibility requirement.
(Findings of Fact, No. 3).

§10—76b-l Authority states in relevant pait. .. “These regulations shall be
applicable to all boards of education as deﬁned by these regulations.” The
Connecticut Technical High School System is the board of education for Cheney
Tech. (Findings of F act, N0. 7).

§10-76d—l Special Education, states in relevant part “Each board of education
shall provide a free, appropriate public education for each child requiring special
education and related services described in subdivision (i) of subpai'agraph (A) of
subsection (4) of section 10—76a—1 and subparagraph (B) of subsection (4) of
section 10—76a—1 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies and for each
preschool child requiring special education and related services. . . .. (a) General
requirements. Each board of education shall provide special education and related
services in accordance with the following requirements.

(1) Such education shall be consistent with the requirements of law and
regulation;

(2) Such education shall be provided under public supervision at public expense
and at no cost to parents; provided that, if a child is eligible for any public or
private insurance, or health or welfare beneﬁt, nothing in this section shall be
construed as relieving the insurer or provider from an otherwise valid obligation
to provide or to pay for any service 01‘ sewices;

(3) Such education shall be in conformity with the child's individualized
education program; . . . .”

The Student’s IEP dated 5/3/12 has been deemed to be inappropriate, as were the
subsequent IEP’s which followed and/or were derivatives of that IEP. The
Student was denied a FAPE as a result of the procedural and substantive defects
identified above.

The Board cites §10-76q as the legal justiﬁcation for removing the Student from
Cheney Tech, if the PPT determines that the Student’s needs preclude attendance
at the program The question arises as to when a PPT isjustiﬁed in concluding
that a student’s needs are so great as to prevent a program from meeting the

26

October 11, 2013 Final Decision and Order 13—0321

student’s needs. The regulations do not identify when that threshold is met, 01'
even the criteria to be considered. (RSCA §10-76a et seq.)

52. 34 C.F.R. §300.1 16(b) the placement decision, states in relevant pait, that the
determination ot'a proper placement for a disabled child “is based on the child’s
IEP; and. . .”. The Board has made a placement decision to send the Student back
to his sending LEA, however that decision was made based upon an inappropriate
2013-2014 IEP. To follow the dictates of§300.1 16(b) correctly, it is required that
the IEP be developed correctly and fully prior to the determination of placement
As such, the Board’s decision on placement must follow the development of a
proper IEP, not precede it. When a proper IEP is developed, with the proper
determination of what supports and services meet the Student’s unique needs, the
Board will then be in a proper position to determine if Cheney Tech is capable of
providing the program and services that this Student needs.

10. The Board will immediately convene a PPT meeting which includes the mandated
participants to address all of the Student’s unique needs, including transition planning
and services; conduct a functional behavior analysis with proper behavioral data, which
will determine what speciﬁc services and program, are required by the Student to be
successful in the current placement.

1 1. Once the IEP is developed, the PPT will address if the placement and program are
such that can be provided to the Student at Cheney Tech and make a placement decision

based upon the IEP.

12. The Board will provide the Student compensatory services in the form of tutoring for
the core subject (Math, English, Social Studies, Science) areas. The Board will provide
one hour of tutoring per week for each of the four subjects, totaling four (4) hours per
week of tutoring for one academic year.

13‘ Should, after the IEP is developed, the PPT come to the determination that Cheney
Tech is not able, based upon the dictates of IDEA, to properly provide the program and
sewices that the Student needs, and a return to the sending LEA is warranted, CTHSS
will retain responsibility for the funding of the compensatory sewices required in number
