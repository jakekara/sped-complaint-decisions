FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

ISSUES:

1. Was the program provided by the Board for the 2013-2014 school year appropriate and did it provide
the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment
(LRE)? If not;

2. Was the unilateral placement of the Student at Eastern County Day School (ECDS) appropriate and
does it provide a meaningful education?

3. Should Parent be reimbursed for the cost of the unﬂateral placement at ECDS for the 2013-2014
school year including transportation?

4. Should the Board reimburse the Parents for the cost of the sessions of the Student with Dr.
Pomeraniec?

5. Is the Student entitled to Compensatory education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed as Other Health Impaired—Central Auditory Processing Disorder and is entitled
to receive FAPE as deﬁned in IDEA 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et seq.
At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rej ected the program offered by the Board for the
2013—3014 school year. The Parents requested reimbursement for their unilateral placement of the Student at
ECDS. The Board refused the Parents’ request. The Parents ﬁled for due process.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on April 24, 2014 and a pre—hearing conference was held on June 2,
2014. A hearing date of July 29, 2014 was chosen by the parties. In an electronic transmission dated July 28,
2014, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties had reso1ved the matter but needed
additional time to ﬁnalize the agreement. In a later electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney advised the
hearing ofﬁcer that the agreement had been ratiﬁed. The Parents withdrew their request for due process with
prejudice. The date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order was extended to accommodate the parties’
mediation and the hearing dates. The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order is August 29, 2014.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
comt by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
