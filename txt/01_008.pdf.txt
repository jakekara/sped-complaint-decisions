July 25, 2001 -1- Final Decision and Order 01-008  STATE OF CONNECTICUT  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION   Student v. Danbury Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parents: Attorney Marc P. Mercier      Beck & Eldergill, P.C.      447 Center Street      Manchester, Connecticut 06040  Apearing on behalf of the Board: Attorney Jill Cutler Hodgman       Shipman & Goodwin, LLP      One American Row      Hartford, Connecticut 06103-2819  Appearing before:   Attorney Stacey M. Owens, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUES:   7. Whether a ski trip should be made part of the Student&#8482;s individualized education program (IEP).   8. 2. Whether the Board is responsible for the cost of the ski trip.   SUMMARY:   The Student suffers from dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. He is enrolled at the Kildonen School in Amenia, New York, in accordance with his IEP. His education at the Kildonen School is funded by the Board. A part of the program devised by the Kildonen School to meet the special needs of its students includes an annual ski trip for a fee that must be tendered for students to participate. The Parent claims the ski trip is a mandatory part of the student&#8482;s special education program with Kildonen, and thus, should be paid for by the Board as part of the student&#8482;s IEP to address the areas of social skills and self-esteem. The Board, however, does not regard the ski trip as mandatory, nor does it deem the ski trip to be a required part of the Student&#8482;s IEP to address the Student&#8482;s social skills and self-esteem.
