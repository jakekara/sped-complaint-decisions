At the request of the parties, the hearing dates of January 16, 2015, January 27, 2015, and February 10,

indicated that the parties had reached a settlement, had reduced such to writing, and were circulating the
agreement for signatures. On that same date the parties were informed that if both Requests were not
withdrawn before 4:00 pm. on March 6, 2015, the matter would be dismissed on the record on the ﬁrst
date of hearing, March 9, 2015. Attorney for the Board sent a communication withdrawing the Board’s
