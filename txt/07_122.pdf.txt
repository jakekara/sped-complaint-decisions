Hearing Officer     FINAL DECISION
 AND ORDER
    PROCEDURAL SUMMARY:
    Subsequent to a prehearing conference a Motion to
 Dismiss was f
iled by the Hartland Board of Education (hereinafter &#64257;Board&#64258;) for reasons of co
llateral estoppel and res judicata.  The Parent, 
representing the Student, (hereinafter &#64257;Parent&#64258;) o
pposed the Motion.  Both 
parties filed briefs and 
presented arguments.  This Final Decision and Or
der sets forth the Hearing Officer&#8482;s findings of 
fact and conclusions of law.  To
 the extent that findings of fact
 actually represent conclusions of 
law, they should be so considered, and vice versa.  For reference, see 
SAS Institute Inc. v. S&H 
Computer Systems, Inc., 605
 F. Supp. 816, (March 6, 1985)
 and Bonnie Ann F. v. Callallen 
Independent School District
, 835 F.Supp.340 (S.D.Tex. 1993). FINDINGS OF FACT: 1.  The Student, through his Pa
rent, filed a request for due process dated May 2, 2007 and received by the Due Process Unit of the State Department of Education on May 4, 2007.   The 
issue in dispute was stated, in its entirety, as follows:  &#64257;The issue(s) in dispute are as follows:  
The Hartland District failed to comply with proc
edural requirements of IDEA in failing to assess 

[the Student] &#64257;in all areas related to the suspected disability&#64258; from the time of his classification-
specifically failing to assess his social and emoti
onal status, neurological processing difficulties, 

impaired sensory difficulties, and his hypersensitiv
ity relating to his disability of Autism and 
negatively affecting his ability to obtain FAPE as a direct result.  This is directly contrary to 34 CFR 300.304 (c) 3 and 4.  His 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 school year IEP&#8482;s have not been reasonably calculated to enable 
[the Student] to receive educational benefits and appropriateness for his disability.  Nor did it take into account his severe emotiona
l status/anxiety, as testified to by his psychiatrist and the district&#8482;s school psychologist that he now has as a secondary disability due to the inappropriateness and findings of the 2004-2005 IEP.&#64258;   

 
2. The Parent did not identify a proposed re
solution but rather wr
ote: &#64257;I suggest the
