Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The prehearing in this matter was conducted on April 25, 2006.  Both parties participated 
and hearing dates that were agreed to were selected.  The issues in dispute were a failure to properly evaluate, a failure to identify, a failure to provide FAPE and a claim for 
compensatory education.  The date for mailing of the final decision was set by agreement 

at July 12, 2006. The parties indicated they were going to pursue an advisory opinion and 
the hearing dates were adjusted to allow time for that to occur.  Prior to the first day of 

hearing the parents&#8482; counsel  advised that the parents were withdrawing their request for due process to allow them time to consider some of the issues raised during the 

settlement negotiations.   
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
