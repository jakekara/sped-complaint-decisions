Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  The Student&#8482;s attorney submitted a Statement of Issues on July 13, 2005 [Exhibit H.O.-2] 
which identified the following issues for this hearing: 
 1. Whether the Board has proposed a free and appropriate public education for the 
Student for the 2005-2006 school year. 2. Whether the Student&#8482;s program shall include the related services as requested by 
the Student as the Student alleges that her 2005-2006 IEP is not appropriate in that it does not provide for transportation to and from her job exploration and 
work experience provided for in the 2005-2006 IEP, and that it does not provide 
for payment for a driver&#8482;s education program as recommended by the expert 
consultants. 3. Whether the IEP does not provide for an education that is 
free in that the amounts 
the Student is paid for the work experience called for in her IEP have been 
reported to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development 
which in turn has reduced the family&#8482;s Section 8 housing subsidy and increased 

the rent the family must pay to remain in their apartment. 
4. Whether the Student/Family is entitled to payment of costs, expert fees and 
attorneys&#8482; fees associated with this action.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY/DISCUSSION:
