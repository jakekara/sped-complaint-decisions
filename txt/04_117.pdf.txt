 Appearing before:     Attorney Gail K. Mangs, Hearing Officer 
        FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  1.  Did the school district provide FAPE during the 2003-2004 school year?

3.  Has the school district complied with the procedural requirements of the IDEA? 
  FINDINGS OF FACT/CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:  This hearing was requested on May 7, 2004.  The prehearing conference was convened on May 17, 2004, at which time the hearing was scheduled, with the Parent&#8482;s agreement, 
for June 14, 15 and 17, 2004.  On June 14, 2004, the Parent did not appear for the hearing.  The hearing officer telephoned the Parent&#8482;s home and left a message on the 

answering machine stating that the hearing would be postponed until June 17, 2004 at 
which time the Parent would be expected to go forward or the hearing would be 
dismissed.  A registered letter containing the same information was also sent by the 

hearing officer to the Parent on June 14, 2004.  At the hearing convened on June 17, 2004, the Parent again did not appear.  The hearing officer telephoned the Parent&#8482;s home 
but reached a fax signal.  As the Parent has been given a reasonable opportunity to go 
forward with the hearing but has failed to do so, the hearing will be dismissed.   
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  This hearing is dismissed.
