physical therapy evaluations (B—20), They also requested placement at Options and two years
of compensatory education. BOE denied the requests (Stip FOF 12)l BOE felt that it could
provide appropriate assessments and program for Student (B~20).

On November 1, 2010, Student’s Attorney wrote to BOE’S Attorney indicating that Student’s
Parents had not been contacted regarding Student’s homebound tutoring (P—56).

On November 22, 2010, Student’s Parents ﬁled a Complaint with the State Depaﬁment of
Education regarding homebound tutoring and failure to evaluate Student (1157), A decision
was rendered on March 4, 2011. The State Depattment ot‘Education’s Bureau of Special
Education concluded that BOE did not timely implement tutoring as recommended by the
PPT and that BOE addressed the noncompliance by providing compensatory tutoring to
Student (P—58), Further correspondence pertaining to the Complaint occurred on March 1 1,
March 14, March 18, and April 12, 2011 and contests the timely offer and/or provision 01~
compensatory tutoring hours (Stip POP 14; P—57; l’—58; B—22; P»60; 13-61)‘

Homebnund tutoring began on December 2, 2010 (P-58). BOE owed Student compensatory
services for the homebound tutoring that was missed from October 25, 2010 to December 2,
2010 (P—58).

On December 6, 2010, Student’s Private Clinician sent another copy of the note with a
revised return to school date 01‘ April 1, 201 1 (P—34). Student’s Father would not give consent
for Private Clinician and School Social Worker to discuss Student’s disability or needs
(School Social Worker).

Via letter dated March 1 1, 201 1, BOE notiﬁed Student’s Parents that the compensatory
tutorial sewices offered to Student remain in effect and that he is 10 receive forty additional
hours of services. The letter further stated that BOE is not obligated to make up tutoring
services missed due to cancellations by Student or Student’s Parents (B-22).

On March 30, 2011, Student’s Attorney forwarded a letter from Student’s treating clinicians
to BOE’s Attorney (Slip FOF 15; P—63). The letter recommended the Options program for
Student.

On March 30, 201 1, Student’s Parents ﬁled a request for Due Process with the State
Department ot‘lidueation (HO-l). On April 29, Student’s Parents ﬁled an Amended Request
for Due Process (Stip FOF 16; I-lO—2).

Student had extensive absences during the 2010-1 1 school year (P64)

In March and April 2011, Parent’s Attorney contacted the State Department ofEducation and
BOE’s Attorney to indicate that no compensatory tutoring had been provided (P~60; P—64).
Special Education Coordinator testiﬁed that Student’s tutor was not able to ﬁt the
compensatory hours into his schedule during the school year. She did not contact anyone else
to provide the compensatory tutoring services during the school year.

Student did not attend school during the 2010—1 1 school year (Student’s Mother).

The compensatory tutoring services were provided during summer 201 1 by Fermi High
School Math Chair. She tutored Student in math connections which is a regular education
pi‘e-algebra class and in world history which is the ninth grade regular education social
studies course. She tutored him in these courses because he failed them the previous school
year.

Fermi High School Math Chair was scheduled to work with Student for seven sessions that
last two to two and one-halfhours each (Fermi High School Math Chair). She found Student
to be extremely cooperative in the tutoring sessions which took place at the public library.
Fermi High School Math Chair believes that Student is very capable of performing grade
level work. He was able to complete all 01" the tasks that she gave him. She pre—tested Student
in math and continued from where he could not successfully complete the pre-test Fermi
High School Math Chair spoke with Student’s previous tutor to determine where to begin in
world history. Student was performing grade level work in the regular curriculum textbook
and ancillary associated materials (Fermi High School Math Chair)

Scheduling problems arose early in the tutoring sessions. Student and/or Student’s Mother
cancelled some tutoring sessions. On other occasions, Fermi High School Math Chair went to
the library at the designated times but Student did not show up, Fermi High School Math
Chair called Student’s home and left voice—mail messages. She did not hear back from
Student or Student’s Parents. She never heard from or saw them again (Fermi High School
Math Chair).

On August 30, 201 1, Special Education Coordinator wrote to Student’s Parent to schedule a
PPT meeting. She offered three dates on which she was available: September 6, 8, and 13 (P—
68).

September 6 was the ﬁrst day 01‘ the 2011—12 school year (P—68). There was no IEP in effect
for Student at the beginning 01‘ the 2011-12 school year (B—20; P-71).

On September 6, 201 1, Student‘s Attorney wrote to BOE’s Attorney conﬁrming a phone
conversation between them on August 30 about availability for a PPT meeting. Student’s
Attorney asked if BOE was available on September 20 and, if not, asked them to provide
alternative dates (P-69).

There is no evidence in the record that BOB responded to Student’s Attorney’s letter.

A PPT meeting was held on September 13, 2011 without Student’s Parents (P-70; P—71). The
purpose Ofthe PPT meeting was to conduct an annual review; transition planning; and
develop an 1E1). The resulting IEP was based on a review 01‘ records and report of Fermi High
School Math Chair’s tutoring results.

The IEP made plans for the current and next school year. The PPT recommended: one period
per day of academic support for this year and next year; co—taught English class this year and
next; co-taught U .8. History this year; co-taught World History next year; co—taught pre-
algebra this year; math in daily living class second semester; direct social work services for
twenty minutes per week; meeting with the transition coordinator ten times per year this year
and next; CAPT in an alternate setting; implementation ofa behavior plan (P-71).

The proposed behavior plan was not attached to the IEP 01‘ introduced into evidence.

The present levels of academic achievement and functional performance section 01‘ the 1EP
indicates Student’s grades as follows: English 10 a B; Math Connections — 0; Biology — C;
PE/Health — B+; Civics ~ B; Reading 2 B; Teen Leadership ~ B; Modern World History ~ B
(P—71).

BOE’S Transition Coordinator works with students at both of BOE’s high schools. She is
familiar with Student but had not yet met him at the time of the hearing (Transition
Coordinator). She was asked to attend Student’s September 13, 201 1 PPT meeting. She was
not asked to work with Student prior to this PPT meeting. She had not reviewed Student’s
records prior to the hearing. She is not aware of his disabilities or capabilities. She did not
make any recommendations for Student at the PPT meeting.

On September 14, 201 1, BOE’s Attorney e-mailed Student’s Attorney stating that Student’s
Parents were told that a PPT meeting would be held on September 13 if they did not respond
to the letter offering several dates (P—70). BOE’s Attorney offered to hold a PPT meeting on
September 20, as requested by Student’s Attorney, if it started at 1 1:00 am. 01‘ ea1'1ier.

101.BOE staff were aware that Student’s Father was not available before 1] :00 am. due to his
own medical condition (Special Education Coordinator; Fermi Special Education Department
Chair; Fermi High School Principal).

102. All PPT meetings provided in the documentary record occurred. There is disagreement
between the parties as to what occurred during the meetings and whether all of the meetings
were legal under IDEA (Stip FOF 13),

103. BOB staff and teachers involved in Student’s education and PPT meetings felt that Student’s
Father was forceful and demanding and difﬁcult to please. They testiﬁed that Student’s
Father spoke over people at Pl’T meetings, tried to turn it to the direction he wanted, and
disregarded and disrespected other people in the process.

104. Student’s Father put restrictions on when and how school staff could communicate with him
Many communications from Student’s Father were difﬁcult to decipher.

105. The Options program’s mission is to increase the competitive skills of students through
academic support; decrease anxieties from other social settings and vocational and
transitional services; evaluate students’ career interests, aptitudes, and values; and look at
how their disabilities affect functioning (Options Director; P—67). The program consists of
one—on-one tutoring and limited peer socialization opportunities. Options only accepts
students referred by the local education agency (“LEA”). Options implements IEPs prepared

by the referring LEA,

2001 (2007).

A school district has a right to conduct its own evaluation utilizing the professiona1(s) of its
own choosing prior to a parent obtaining a second opinion through an independent
educational evaluation.

The standard for determining whether FAPE has been provided is a two-pronged inquiry:
ﬁrst, whether the procedural requirements of IDEA have been met, and second, whether the
1EP is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational beneﬁts. Board of
Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v Rowley 458 US. 176 (1982).
The proper gauge for determining educational progress is “whether the educational program
provided for a child is reasonably calculated to allow the child to receive ‘meaningful’
educational beneﬁts.” Mrs. B. v. Milford Board 01' Education, 103 F.3d 11 14, 1120 (2d Cir.
1997).

An appropriate pubhe education under IDEA is one that is “1ike1y to produce progress, not
regression.” Walczak v. Florida Union Free Sch. Dist. 142 F.3d 1 19, 130 (2d Ch: 1998), The
IDEA does not require that the school district provide the best available educational program
01' one that maximizes a student's educational potential. Mrs. B. v. Milford Bd. of Educ, 103
F.3d1114, 1121 (2d Cir. 1997).

Factors to be considered in determining whether an 1EP is reasonably calculated to provide a
meaningful educational beneﬁt is whether the proposed program is individualized 0n the
basis of the student's assessment and performance and whether it is administered in the least
restrictive environment. 20 U.S.C. §1412(a)(5)(A); 34 CFR § 300.114(a); A.S. v. Board 01‘

the PPT at the time the IEPS were developed. B. L. v. New Britain Bd. 01" Educ, 394 F. Supp‘
2d 522, 537 (D. Conn. 2005).

Discussion

Each of the issues identiﬁed on page two above are addressed in this Discussion section.
They are addressed in chronological order, instead of the order as stated above, to provide better
clarity and understanding of the facts, issues, and decision. All ot‘the parties’ arguments have
been reviewed and considered by the l'lcaring Ofﬁcer and are not necessarily individually
addressed here, Certain arguments and claims will be addressed for illustrative purposes

Where there is found to be a violation ot‘the IDEA, the appropriate remedy is identiﬁed

in the F inal Decision and Orders section aﬁer this Discussion section.

1. Did BOE fail to provide Student with a free appropriate public education from

March 30, 2009 through the end of the 2008—2009 school year?

Student was in eighth grade at BOE’s Middle School during the 2008—09 school year
Student’s most recent evaluation (Dr. Kulas in 2006-07) recommended that Student be serviced
in the mainstream classroom with repetition and opportunity for re—teachjng (P—16). He also
recommended that social development and social interaction skills be made a priority in
Student’s educational program and that Student must be given the opportunity to fail in order to
provide exposure to situations that will decrease his anxiety in the long—term.

The PPT met on June 5, 2008 to conduct an annual review (P—25). At that time“ Student’s
eligibility category was Speech 01‘ Language Impairment. The PPT received teacher reports of
Student‘s grades and progress.

The present levels of academic achievement and functional performance section of the
IEP indicated that Student was at age appropriate level for language arts, math, non—academic
areas, and behavioral/social/emotional. It also noted that Student has weaknesses in language
skills and needs reassurance with social perceptions. Student’s communication skills were not

deemed age appropriate.

19

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0374

The IEP included communication and social/bchavioral goals and objectives
implemented by, respectively, the speech and language pathologist and social worker. The PPT
recommended average classes for science, social studies, English, and math; developmental
reading; social work sewices 30 minutes per week; speech and language services once a month
{01' 40 minutes; standard administration ofthe eighth grade CMT; weeka communication log to
he sent home and monitored by the special education teacher; all classes scheduled on the first
ﬂoor to accommodate Student’s medical condition; special van transportation due to his medical
condition; an extra set 01‘ books at home; the PPT to meet at progress report time to review his
progress; and the following additional modiﬁcations and accommodations: extra set of books in
each classroom; modiﬁed worksheets when necessary; calculator; extra time on quizzes when
appropriate; rephrase questions/directions; modiﬁed tests if necessary; grade effort and work;
assess major concepts in social studies and science; take medical problems into account; elective
grades adjusted by the amount oftime he is out 01‘ class for speech and language therapy and
social work services; daily assignment list; seated so he can hear and his back is comfottable; do
not reprimand for speaking loudly due to hearing loss; math, English, social studies, and science
in a collaborative setting; positive reinforcement; cue expected behavior; check work in progress;
review directions; special pass to allow him to pass before and after regular passing time as
needed and to leave the classroom for medical reasons (P—25).

The PPT excused Student from physical education due to his medical condition and
permitted him to take a full year ofshop class instead

The [BF indicates that no requested actions were refused. Student’s Father was present at
the PPT meeting and shared information/concerns Student’s proposed program was
individualized on the basis of his assessment and performance and was administered in the least
restrictive environment,

A PPT meeting was held on May 29, 2009 to plan an evaluation/reevaluation and conduct
an annual review (B—9). The resulting lEP primarily dealt with Student’s transition to high school
for the following school year.

Student, Student’s Mother, and Student’s Father attended the May 29, 2009 PPT meeting.
The notes indicate that Student’s Father “is pleased with the transition [Student] has made to
[BOE M iddle School]. He appreciates the work that the teachers have done over these last two

years.” He also stated that Middle School Principal has been great assisting Student for the last

20

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1-0374

two years at BOE Middle School and in working on a smooth transition to high school (B—9).
The IEP indicates that no requested actions were refused.

There is minimal evidence indicating Student’s performance or progress during his eighth
grade year (2008—09). Student was absent for the eighth grade CMT (P-27). His ﬁnal grades were
one B+, one B—, three C+, and four Cs (P-29). He was absent 64 times (more than one—third of
the 180 school days). Student’s Mother testiﬁed that Student never attended a full day 01‘school
during his eighth grade year due to medical issues related to his back surgery She also testiﬁed
that Student struggled with homework and class work, including reading, math and history.

The documentary evidence in this case indicates that Student’s Father is not hesitant to
contact BOE when he has concerns or disagrees with actions or inactions of school staff,
However, there is no evidence of concerns about Student’s performance 01‘ progress from March
30, 2009 through the end ofthe 2008-09 school year. The evidence indicates that BOB reviewed
Student’s then—present levels of performance, progress and needs when designing this eighth
grade IEP and that BOE provided numerous accommodations, modiﬁcations, and supports to
Student during the year. The uncontested evidence fuﬁher indicates that Student’s Father was
pleased with Student’s transition to BOE Middle School. There is no evidence 01‘ any concerns,
issues, or problems with Student’s 2008-09 eighth grade IEP.

BOE met its burden ot‘proving that it offered Student a free appropriate public education

from March 30, 2009 through the end of the 2008-09 school year.

11. Did BOE fail to provide Student with a free appropriate public education during the

2009-10 school year?

Student was in ninth grade and scheduled to attend Enfield High School during the 2009-
10 school year The PPT met on May 29, 2009 to plan an evaluation/reevaluation and conduct an
annual review (B-9). At that time, Student’s eligibility category was Speech 0r Language
Impairment.

The PPT recommended average classes for science, social studies, English, and math
with modiﬁcations; 30 minutes weekly social work services; speech and language services on a
consultative basis for ninth grade; weekly communication sheet sent home for ﬁrst six weeks 01‘
high school monitored by special education teacher; case conference with Student’s Parents and

high school staff after a four to six week transition period; special van transportation for morning

21

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 10374

pick-up in ninth grade; use of elevator at high school; extra set of books provided at home; pass
for early class transition and to go to nurse or lavatory; guidance counselor at high school to be
contact person for transition needs; escort assigned to assist in hall passing during transition
period; high school Visit for Student and Student’s Parents; and reevaluation (B9)

The PPT also reconunended the following additional modiﬁcations and accommodations:
modiﬁed worksheets when necessary; calculator; extra time on quizzes when appropriate;
rephrase questions/directions; modified tests ifnecessary; grade effort and work; assess major
concepts in social studies and science; take medical problems into account; elective grades
adjusted by the amount of time he is out of class for social work services; daily assignments
written in planner; seated so he can hear and his back is comfortable; math, English, social
studies, and science in an average setting; positive reinforcement; cue expected behavior; cheek
work in progress; review directions; collaborative teachers may provide modiﬁed work to be
used in average class; special pass to allow him to pass before and after regular passing time as
needed and to leave the classroom to go to the nurse or lavatory (B9).

The present levels of academic achievement and functional performance section of the
IEP indicated that Student was at age appropriate level for language arts, math, other academic
and non—academic areas, and behavioral/social/emotional. It noted that Student has weaknesses
in language skills and needs reassurance with social perceptions and interactions (B9).

The IEP included a communication and academic/cognitive goal with three objectives
that were implemented in the regular classroom by the special education teacher, speech and
language pathologist, and regular education teacher; a transition goal (since this IEP would be in
effect at the time he turned 16) implemented by the guidance counselor; and a social/behavioral
goal with two objectives relative to counseling with the social worket:

The IEP indicates that no requested actions were refused. Student’s Parents and Student
were present at the PPT meeting. As indicated above, under Issue One, the IEP notes indicate
that Student’s F ather “is pleased with the transition {Student} has made to [BOE Middle School]
and that Middle School Principal has been great assisting Student for the last two years at BOB
Middle School and in working on a smooth transition to high school (B-9). Student’s Parents did
indicate concerns about Student’s safety and medical issues, Accommodations such as the early
passing time, the pass allowing Student to go to the nurse or lavatory at any time, use of the

elevator, and extra sets of books were responsive to those concerns

22

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0374

Student’s Mother testiﬁed that she told the PPT that Student was not beneﬁtting from
special education and that he needed more services. She did not identify what services or types
of services she felt were missing from the IEP. The letters from Student’s Father primarily raise
concerns about Student getting in an altercation or ﬁght with students involved in the summer
attack. The PPT meeting minutes do not reﬂect a request for more or additional services.

At the October 13. 2009 PPT meeting, Student’s Parents requested that Student be
transferred to another high school and that he be exited from special education against the
recommendation of the Special Education Department Chair. Student’s Father refused
continuing special education services for Student, Student was exited from special education.
Student’s Father indicated that the request for a school transfer was due to safety cencerns
related to Student’s previous altercations with other students.

Student was on homebound tutoring from January 4 to January 28, 2010 (B~10), In
January 2010, Student transferred to Fermi H igh School and Student’s Parents sought to
reintroduce special education services.

At the PPT meeting on January 25, 2010, Student was found eligible to receive sewices
as a special education student under the category of Multiple Disabilities (Stip FOF 9; 13—7).
Student’s Mother testiﬁed that no one explained why Student’s eligibility category was changed
from Speech 01' Language Impairment 10 Multiple Disabilities.

The IEP indicates that Student was working at grade level in most classes, that he has
weaknesses in language skills, and that he needs reassurance with social perceptions and
interactions.

The PPT recommended that Student receive direct social work services; two support
classes daily; tutoring during the school day to assist with transition; exemption from physical
education due to medical reasons; health portion 01‘ physical education to be covered by a tutor;
English and History co~taught classes; van to and from school; permanent pass to the nurse,
elevator use, early passing to lunch, and early/delayed passing to classes; copies oftextbooks to
be kept in the classroom and one copy provided for use at home; building tour; meeting every
few weeks with Student’s Parents, social worker, assistant principal, and case manager to review
transition and academic/social progress; reconvene in May to plan for next school year; grades

based on class work and modiﬁed homework; Student’s Parents to be notiﬁed of any issues

23

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1-0374

occurring during the school day (B—7). Each of Student’s Father’s requested items were included
in the IEP (B—6; B-7),

Student’s Mother testiﬁed that Student’s transition to Fermi High School was good from
January until April 2010. On March 27, 2010, Student was involved in an off-eampus verbal
altercation with students involved in the summer 2009 incident, Then, on April 7, 2010, Student
was suspended for hitting a student at school.

School staff repeatedly indicated that Student’s absence from school negatively impacted
his academic progress. Student was absent from school 32 times during the ﬁrst semester (B— 1 0),
Student was absent 25 times (not including his suspension) and tardy 28 times during the second
semester (B—10). Many of Student’s absences were for medical appointments and/or due to his
back injury or illness (P—34; Student’s Mother). Student also missed time from class during the
day to go to the nurse when he had back pain or other illnesses or problems (P-SS).

The evidence indicates that, when planning Student’s lEl’s for 200910, BOE reviewed
Student’s then—present levels ot‘performance, progress and needs and that BOE provided
numerous accommodations, modiﬁcations, and supports to Student. The [BF was reasonably
calculated to enable Student to receive meaningful educational beneﬁts. Student’s program was
individualized on the basis ol‘ his assessments and performance and was administered in the least
restrictive enviromnent.

Student’s Parents’ primary argument is that Student was denied FAPE due to bullying or
harassment and that BOE did not take appropriate actions to ensure Student’s safety in school
Student’s Father wrote several letters expressing concern about Student’s safety in school as a
result of altercations that occurred out of school, He expressed concern that the other students
involved in those altercations, or friends on their behalf, were threatening or would threaten or
intimidate Student in school.

BOB provided supports and contacts for Student within school to allow him to discuss
any safety concerns and to get himself to a safe location if he felt threatened. BOE staff testified
that Student did not express fear or concerns about bullying, even when asked, and that he did
not often use the early/delayed passing pass that would allow him to avoid students in the
hallways.

The record supports a ﬁnding that Student’s absences were primarily for medical reasons

(i.e. doctor’s appointments, pain and discomfort as a result ol‘back injury and surgery,

24

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1-0374

medication management). There is not sufﬁcient evidence in the record to make a ﬁnding that
Student was subjected to severe or prolonged harassment or bullying at school or that BOE was
deliberately indifferent to any such conduct so as to deprive Student of the beneﬁt of his special
education services.

The evidence also suppotts a ﬁnding that Student’s Father is controlling, has regularly
intervened on Student’s behalf, prohibited Student from being a regular active participant in his
PPT, and sheltered Student from opportunities to develop necessary coping skills. Dr. Kulas’
report states that Student’s Parents “appear to he shielding him from opportunities to develop
[functional] skills in an attempt to protect him” (P—16).

Student’s Parent’s concern for Student’s health and safety is commendable. l-lowever, it
cannot be a shield to interfere in Student’s academic and social success at school D11 Kulas
further stated that Student must be given the opportunity to fail in order to provide exposure to
situations that will decrease his anxiety in the long—term.

The record supports a ﬁnding that Student’s excessive absences impact his academic and
social progress and success. Teacher reports indicate that Student generally performs well and at
grade level when in school and that his absences negatively impact his performance.

BOE met its burden of proving that it offered Student a free appropriate public education

during the 2009—10 school year.

III. Did BOE fail to appropriately evaluate Student?

A school district must conduct a reevaluation of each child with a disability at least once
every three years, unless the parent and school district agree that reevaluation is not necessary.
34 CFR § 300i303(b)(2). A school district must ensure that a student is assessed in all areas
related to his suspected disability,

The most recent evaluations included in the documentary evidence are the
neuropsychological evaluation in November 2006 and January 2007 and a physical therapy
screening in April 2007 (P-l6; P‘21). Other than record reviews, Student has not undergone any
formal evaluation or assessments since early 2007.

Student should have been evaluated no later than January 2010 unless Student’s Parents
and BOE agreed that re—evaluation was not necessary. Student had been exited from special

education in October 2009 at Student’s Parents’ request. He was transferred to Fermi High

25

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0374

School in January 2010. Student’s Parents requested that a PPT meeting be held on January 25,
2010 to “re—inti'oduce” Student to special education (B-6). The PPT meeting notice indicated that
the purpose was to “discuss a referral to special education and consider/plan an evaluation" (B-
7). Howeveix the IEP itselfdoes not indicate that planning 01‘ reviewing an evaluation 01‘ re-
evaluation was one of the reasons for the meeting.

Other than a review ofi‘ecords, an evaluation was not offered 01‘ conducted. There is no
evidence that an evaluation 01'1'e-evaluati0n was discussed. The PPT found Student eligible for
special education under a different category: Multiple Disabilities. The Prior Written Notice
section of the IEP indicates that evaluation results suppott the proposed actions. However, it does
not indicate what evaluation supports the actions.

The June 14, 2010 PPT meeting notes indicate that this was Student’s annual PPT
meeting and a meeting to plan his triennial evaluation (13—1 1). At that meeting, the PPT
developed Student’s IEP for 2010-1 1 and Student’s Father signed consent for reevaluation (P—
51). The consent identiﬁed the following tests: WISC/WAIS; WIAT; BASC; speech and
language; and others deemed necessary. The areas ol‘assessment included cognitive.
achievement, social/behavior, and receptive/expressive language. The evaluations were to be
conducted by BOE’S psychologist and speech and language therapist

BOE did not conduct any evaluation of Student. Special Education Coordinator testiﬁed
that Student’s Father’s June 21, 2010 fax stating that Student’s Parents “do not and will not
agree[ ] with the stipulations set forth by the PPT team” was treated as a withdrawal ot‘consent
to evaluate (B—14),5 The fax indicates that Student’s Parents did not feel that they were allowed
to “partake in the verbal communication in behalfol‘ our son.”

The fax does not state that Student’s Parents withdraw consent for evaluation. In fact, the
fax does not even mention the evaluation. No one from BOE inquired of Student’s Parents as to
whether their disagreement with the IEP provisions or PPT meeting process constituted a
withdrawal of consent to evaluate BOE did not follow-up with a timely evaluation or seek to
clarify Student’s Parent’s concerns or position. The issue of the evaluation arose at Student’s
October 25, 2010 PPT meeting (more than four months after Student’s Father signed consent 1‘01.
5 At the pre-hearing conference BOE's Attorney indicated that 3011‘ had ﬁled a request for due process regarding
Student’s Parent’s failure to consent to evaluation and that they (lid not believe that the matter had been assigned to
a Hearing Ofﬁcer. BOE’s Attorney indicated that she would follow up with the Due Process Unit to determine the

status ofthat request and would then ﬁle a motion to consolidate the matters. The Due Process Unit indicated that
they had not received any such request for hearing.

26

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0374

re-evaluation). Student’s Attorney indicated that Student’s Father consented to evaluation and
BOE’S Attorney indicated that consent was withdrawn via the above—reference fax from
Student’s F ather t0 BOE. Special Education Coordinator testiﬁed that she did not contact
Student’s Parents to clarify their intention. BOB did not conduct the evaluations or seek timely
clariﬁcation as to whether consent had been revoked.

BOE failed to appropriately evaluate Student when it did not conduct an evaluation in a

timely manner after receiving signed consent for evaluation.

IV. Did BOE fail to provide Student with a free appropriate public education during the

2010-11 school year?

The PI’T met on June 14, 2010 to plan Student’s 2010-1 1 1E1) (B—1 1). At that time,
Student had not been evaluated in more than three years. The present levels of achievement
section of the IEP indicates that Student has needs in the areas ofdecoding skills, reading
comprehension, attendance, missing assignments, understanding and applying math concepts,
peer interactions, depression and mood swings, disruptive behaviors, organizational ski1ls,
spelling skills, socia1 skills, and anxiety as reported by Student’s Parents.

Student’s IEP does not include goals or objectives addressing most of the areas of
concern in the present level of achievement section. The IEP indicates that it will continue the
previous year’s goals and objectives until his triennial evaluation is completed. The goals
include: 1) demonstrate growth in academic and social skills decision making in order to increase
self—esteem; and 2) complete series ofactivities to prepare to transition to competitive
employment As indicated above, the triennial eva1uation was not completed.

A week after the PPT meeting, Student’s Parents indicated in writing that they do not
agree to the stipu1ations set fmth in the IEP, 1n fall 2010, they requested homebound tutoring for
Student, which was eventually ordered by the PPT in October 2010 but did not begin until
December 2, 2010. Student’s 2010—1 1 IEP expired on January 4, 201 1 (B-20). There was no IEP
in place for the remainder of the 2010-1 1 school year. Student did not attend school during the
2010—1 1 school year.

The PPT did not plan an IEP that addressed Student’s then—present levels 01‘ performance
or that was individualized 0n the basis of timely assessments or that was administered in the least

restrictive environment.

27

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1-0374

BOE did not meet its burden of proving that it offered Student a free appropriate public

education during the 2010-1 1 school year,

V. Did BOE fail to offer Student a free appropriate public education (luring the 2011
extended school year?

Student’s 2010—1 1 [BF expired on January 4, 201 1 (B—20). Student’s PPT did not meet
again until September 13, 2011 (P—71). The PPT did not meet to determine whether Student
required extended school year (“ESY”) services during summer 201 1. Special Education
Coordinator testiﬁed that Student was never offered ESY; that she did not recall it being
discussed at his PPT meetings and since the team didn’t bring it up, she wasn’t concerned about
it; and that the PPT did not recommend ESY because Student “doesn’t have the proﬁle 01" a
Student that usually gets it.”

A school district must convene a PPT meeting to determine whether ESY services are
necessary to the provision of FAI’E. 34 CFR § 300.106. BOB did not convene a PPT meeting to
determine whether ESY sewices were necessary for the provision of FAPE to Student.

The evidence indicates that Student missed substantial amounts ol‘school due to illness
and/or medical issues necessitating him to make up missed coursework; that he performs at grade
level when receiving small group and/or one-on—one instruction and re-teaching; and that he
beneﬁts from social work sewices. The evidence also suggests that Student would beneﬁt from
tutoring to allow him to catch up missed coursework and to receive I'e-teaching.

BOE has not met its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it
provided FAPE to Student for summer 201 1.

During summer 20] 1, BOE provided Student compensatory tutoring services for time
owed from October to December 2010. Student failed to fully take advantage ot‘those services
due to personal matters unrelated to his disability that made him unavailable (Fermi High School
Math Chair; Student’s Mother). Student cancelled and/or did not show up for tutoring sessions in
July and August 201 1‘ The Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds that, given Student’s unavailability for
programming in the summer, he would not likely have taken advantage of an ESY program, if

offered as a necessary component ot‘FAPE.

28

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0374

VI. Did BOE fail to offer Student a free appropriate public education (hiring the 2011-

12 school year?

There was no IEP in place for Student at the beginning of the 201 1-12 school year. BOE
did not offer to hold a PPT meeting prior to the ﬁrst day of the 201 1—12 school year yet urged
Student to return to school on the ﬁrst day without an IEP, The PPT met on September 13, 2011
without Student’s Parents and without making efforts to accommodate Student‘s Parents’
availability. The PPT developed an 1131’ based on a record review and the report ot‘Student’s
summer tutor based on a few summer tutoring sessions.

Many ot‘the statements and representations in the September 13, 201 1 [HP are not
credible 01‘ supported by the evidence.

Student should be in eleventh grade during the 201 1-12 school year. The IEP indicates
that his current grade is ninth. The IEP states that Regular Education Teacher says he is on grade
level. However, his previous IEP dated October 25, 2010 indicated reading skills at the sixth
grade level, decoding skills at high second grade level, and comprehension at low fourth grade
level (B-20).

The IEP indicates that Guidance Counselor reported Student is on track to graduate next
year (2012-13) if he passes his classes. Student’s transcript from one year earlier indicated that
his anticipated graduation date was 2014 (P63)

The IEP indicates that Student is capable of grade level work, that he performs best in
smaller class settings, and that his inconsistent attendance impacts his academic progress
Student’s repented tenth-grade grades range from 13+ to C—. His ninth—gi‘ade grades ranged from
C— to F (8—20).

Despite not having been in school consistently, having a record indicating that his
absences impact his performance, and having not received or taken advantage of the full
schedule ofhomebound tutoring, it is difﬁcult to imagine how he progressed, advanced his
anticipated graduation date, and improved his grades.

The present level of function and performance page makes no mention of Student’s
behavioral, social, and emotional needs that have consistently been identiﬁed in previous lEPs
and notes from Student’s Private Clinician, Student’s previous lEPs consistently state that
Student needs reassurance with social perceptions and interactions to feel comfortable in school

and that Student’s Parents report that he suffers from anxiety (B-7; B—9; B-1 1; B20; P~25).There

29

February 2. 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0374

is no evidence that those social needs have been resolved. In fact, the evidence suggests the
contrary since Student has been out of school for an extended period ofﬂine and has anxiety
revolving around his attendance and health.

The Transition Planning page of the IEP indicates that “Student will not be 17 within one
year” when in fact, Student turned 17 six months earlier, as indicated on the front page of the
IEP.

The IEP provides increased special education hours in the second semester to add 3.92
hours per week 01‘ math in a self—eontained classroom. Although the IBP identiﬁes Student’s
lowest grade as being in math, the IEP does not provide that increased sewice until the second
semester.

The goal column on page eleven 0f the IEP is blank. The IEP does not indicate which
goals are addressed by which service, service implementer, frequency, date, etce

BOE did not meet its burden of proving, by a preponderance ot‘the evidence, that it

offered Student a free appropriate public education during the 201 1 —12 school year.

VII. Did BOE commit procedural violations that resulted in a denial of FAPE?

Student’s Amended Request for Due Process (HO—2) alleges the following procedural
violations:

Failure to evaluate: This is covered in Issue Three, above.

Failure to mail IEPs in the required timeframe: There is no evidence in the record that
BOE failed to appropriately 01‘ timely mail IEPs t0 Student’s Parents. Student has not met the
burden of production on this issue.

Failure to hold PPT meetings at a convenient time for Student’s Parents to attend: The
PPT convened a manifestation determination meeting on April 16, 2010 without Student’s
Parents despite their request that the PPT meeting not proceed without them and their attorney.
There is no evidence in the record to indicate that BOE attempted to reschedule the meeting to
accommodate Student’s Parents“ request to attend with their attorney. The PPT also met on
September 13, 201 1 without Students Parents and without making efforts to accommodate
Student’s Parents’ availability.

Parents are members 01‘ the PPT. 34 CFR § 300.321, BOE must take steps to ensure that

Student’s Parents are present at each PPT meeting 01' are afforded the oppomtnity t0 pattieipate,

30

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 l<0374

including scheduling the meeting at a mutually convenient time. 34 CFR § 300.322. BOE
presented no evidence of any attempt to arrange a mutually agreed on time for the manifestation
determination PPT meetingi BOE presented evidence of an initial attempt to arrange a mutually
agreed on time for the September 2011 PPT meeting but then appeared to ignore Student’s
Attorney’s response and proceeded at a time not mutually agreed on, BOB then offered to meet
at a time that it knew Student’s Father was not available.

BOE’s actions in conducting PP’I‘ meetings without making reasonable efforts to include
Student’s Parents signiﬁcantly impeded their opportunity to participate in the decision-making
process regarding the provision of FAPE to Student.

Predetermined Student’s program: Student’s only argument in support of this allegation
is that BOB predetermined that Student would only receive in-district service, that only
homebound tutoring was offered at the October 25, 20l l PPT meeting,6 and that no other options
were considered (Student’s Brief at 40). Homebound tutoring was granted at Student’s Father’s
request. BOE’s grant of Student’s Father’s request does not support a ﬁnding of
predetermination. Student has failed to meet the burden of production with regard to
predetermination,

Failure to provide lEP based on Student’s needs: As appropriate and relevant to a
particular IEP, this is considered under issues One through Five above in that it goes to the issue
ot‘whether BOE offered Student l’APE for a given time period.

Failure to provide an appropriate program: As appropriate and relevant to a particular
IEP, this is considered under issues One through Five above in that it goes to the issue 01‘
whether BOE offered Student FAPE for a given time period.

Failure to keep Student safe in school: Student’s Father initially raised concerns about
Student7s safety in school relative to his back injury. Student was given a special pass to allow
him to pass early 01' late to avoid crowds in the halls and to allow him to go to the nurse or
lavatory whenever needed. After the summer fight, Student’s Father’s safety concerns centered
on alleged threats and intimidation in school as a result 01‘ the altercation between Student and
other students off school grounds in the summei: Student’s Father did not raise speciﬁc

allegations or complaints of actual conduct within school.

° The Hearing Officer assumes that Student’s Attorney is referring to the October 25, 2010, not lot 1, PPT meeting
as it was the meeting at which the PPT granted homebound tutoring. There is no October 25, 201 l IEP in the record.

31

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0374

T here is no evidence in the record that Student made any complaints about bullying or
harassment. BOE assigned speciﬁc staff, who would not normally be assigned to Student, to
assist Student in his transition to school and t0 suppott his physical, social, and academic needs.
School Principal, Assistant School Principal, and/or Social Worker from each of his schools
testiﬁed that they worked to establish an open, trusting relationship with Student, that Student
had a pass to meet with administrators any time he wanted, that Student went to see them to talk
about concerns 01‘ problems, and that Student, even when asked, never complained ofbullying or
harassment in school. BOE even transferred Student from one high school to another at Student’s
Father’s request to alleviate any such concerns.

The record supports a ﬁnding that, with one exception, the altercations with Student and
other students occurred off-campus and outside oi'schooi hours. In the one exception, Student
punched another student at school.

The record also supports a ﬁnding that Student’s Father is controlling and over—
protective. He attempted to forbid BOB administrators from talking with Student, refused to
allow School Social Worker and Private Clinician to discuss Student’s anxiety or emotional
needs, and refused to accept communications from BOE when they were not what he wanted to
heaix This has not helped create a trusting environment for Student. Student’s previous
evaluators commented on the importance ofparent/staff collaboration to avoid conﬂict and
resurgence of Student’s anxiety.

There is insufﬁcient evidence in the record to make a ﬁnding that BOE failed to keep
Student safe in school.

Allowed Student to sit home for several months without any educational programming:
As appropriate and relevant to a particular IEP, this is considered under issues One through Five
above in that it goes to the issue of whether BOE offered Student FAPE for a given time period.

Failed to provide compensatory services for missed tutoring time: Student received
homebound tutoring during the 2010-1 1 school year. He was granted compensatory tutoring
services to make up for BOE’s delay in starting homebound tutoring. This was resolved through
the Complaint process at the Due Process Unit. Student failed to take full advantage ol‘the
compensatory services during summer 201 1, This may have been an outstanding issue at the

time that the Amended Complaint was ﬁled but has been addressed since that time.

32

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1,0374

Failed to implement Student’s IEP while on homebound tutoring: As appropriate and
relevant to a particular IEP, this is considered under issues One through Five above in that it goes
to the issue of whether BOE offered Student FAPE for a given time period

Failed to provide an appropriate transition program and services: Not later than the ﬁrst
IEP to be in effect when Student turns sixteen, his IEP must include transition planning services,
34 CFR § 300.320(b)i Not later than one year before Student turns eighteen, his IEP must
include a statement regarding notice 0ftransfer of rights. 34 CFR § 300.320(c),

Student turned sixteen in spring 2010, during his ninth grade year. The ﬁrst IEP to be in
effect at the time he turned sixteen was the May 29, 2009 IEP (8-9). The transition planning
page of that IEP indicates that Student was invited to, attended, and participated in the PPT
meeting with regard to transition planning. The notes indicate that Student is unsure of his
preferences and interests at that time and that he discussed outside interests.

The IEP indicates that he will palticipate in Career Game through the guidance
department during winter ofeighth grade. One of his IEP goals was to complete a career
inventory to assist in determining vocational areas ol‘interest Student’s IEP called for him to
meet with Guidance Counselor four times during the year for this goal.

Student was exited from special education by his parents in October 2010. He was
reinstated to special education at Student’s Parents’ request at a PPT meeting on January 25,
2010. That IEP indicates that the Learning Characteristics assessment will be completed by June
2010. According to the June 14, 2010 lEl’, the assessment was completed and reviewed at the
PPT meeting (B-1 1).

The [BF included goals and objectives relative to post—secondary education 01‘ training
and competitive employment. Student’s goal relative to transition to post-secondary
education/training included objectives for appropriate interaction with peers and adults; ability to
vcrbalize issues and concerns; completion of daily academic assignments with appropriate
modiﬁcations; and requesting assistance from teachers when unsure oi‘assignments, directions,
or tasks.

Student’s goal relative to transition to competitive employment included two sessions in
the career center between January and June 2010.

The present level of performance section of the June 14, 2010 IEP is blank with regard to

vocational/transition (B~l 1). It continues to indicate that the Learning Characteristic will be

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1-0374

completed by June 2010 despite the notation that it was completed and reviewed. Under the
section regarding notice of transfer 0f1'ights, the IEP indicates that Student will not be seventeen
within one year. However, Student did turn seventeen within one year of this PPT meeting.
There is no indication that he was informed of his rights under IDEA transferring at age
eighteen.

The IEP indicates that Student will enroll in vocational courses to assist in determining
his area of interest. Student was not present at the PPT meeting. The June 2010 IEP continued
Student’s previous goals and objectives and added an objective that Student will demonstrate
ability to attend school daily, on time, and to remain in class until dismissed. Student’s goal
relative to transition to competitive employment included three sessions in the career center
and/or with Guidance Counselor during the 2010—1 1 school year.

Transition Coordinator testiﬁed that she was not provided and did not see Student‘s
career inventory. The lEP indicates that he took it in 2010 and that it was reviewed at the PPT
meeting.

Student did not attend school during the 2010-1 1 school year. On October 25, 2010, the
PPT agreed to homebound tutoring. Student did not receive transition services outside of school
during the 2010—1 1 school year.

The present level of performance section 01‘ the October 25, 2010 IEP is blank with
regard to vocational/ti'ansition (B-21)1 The transition planning page is unchanged from the
previous two IEPs (including erroneously stating that he will not be seventeen within one year).
Again, there is no indication that he was informed of his rights under IDEA transferring at age
eighteen, Student’s goals and objectives were changed. His October 25, 2010 IEP includes one
goal: improve his ability to palticipate in his educational program and make good decisions. His
objectives include attendance at daily tutoring sessions, being on time and remaining until the
session is completed; complete and submit all assigned work daily; and verbally and
appropriately express concerns. The IEP did not include transition planning goals and objectives
despite the transition planning page indicating that there were post-secondary education 01‘
training and employment goals and objectives in the 1131’.

Although there was only one goal in his October 2010 IEP, page 11 of the IEP indicates

that goal two is his transition goal and that he will have one transition meeting with the tutor

34

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0374

between October 25, 2010 and January 4, 201 1. The transition goal is not included in the IEP
submitted into evidence (B—20).

Student’s September 13, 201 1 lEP indicates that he will have ten one—on-onc sessions
with Transition Coordinator and that he is em'olled in two periods of Auto 1 (P—71). The
transition planning page continues to indicate that Student will not be seventeen within one year
when he was, in fact, already seventeen. Again, there is no indication that he was informed 01‘ his
rights under IDEA transferring at age eighteen.

Student’s September 13, 201 1 IEP includes a transition goal relative to transition to two-
01' four—year post-secondary education programs and a goal to complete activities to prepare for
transition to competitive employment. Transition Coordinator attended Student’s September 13,
201 1 PPT meeting but did not have input on his transition planning goals. She has not met
Student and had not seen his career inventory,

BOE has not met its burden ofproving that it provided Student appropriate transition
planning services

Failed to provide social skills intervention: As appropriate and 1'e1evant to a particular
1131’, this is considered under issues One through Five above in that it goes to the issue 01‘
whether BOE offered Student FAPE for a given time period.

Failure to conduct functional behavioral assessment and create behavior intervention
11%}? As appropriate and relevant to a particular IEP, this is considered under issues One through
Five above in that it goes to the issue 01‘ whether B013 offered Student FAPE for a given time
period.

Failure to address life skills: As appropriate and relevant to a particu1ar IEP, this is
considered under issues One through Five above in that it goes to the issue of whether BOE
offered Student FAPE for a given time period,

Failure to assess Student’s need for technology: There is no evidence in the record that
Student’s Parents identiﬁed a need for or requested technology for Student or that BOE failed to
assess such need. Student’s independent evaluations did not identify the need for technology (1’—
8; 13-16), Student has not met the burden ofproduction on this issue.

Failure to create a program that addresses Student’s academic disabilities: As appropriate
and relevant to a particular IEP, this is considered under issues One through Five above in that it

goes to the issue ofwhether BOE offered Student FAPE for a given time period.

35

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 1—0374

Failed to respond to Student’s lack of progress in academics: As appropriate and relevant
to a particular TEP, this is considered under issues One through Five above in that it goes to the
issue ofwhether BOE offered Student FAPE for a given time period.

Failed to provide an appropriate IEP: As appropriate and relevant to a particular iBP, this
is considered under issues One through F ive above in that it goes to the issue of whether BOE
offered Student FAPE for a given time period.

Failed to provide appropriate ESY: This is covered in Issue Four, above.

Failed to provide records in a timely manner: There is no evidence in the record that BOE
failed to timely provide records to Student’s Parents. There is one reference to a document
request in the exhibits but it is not clear what documents were requested or whether they were
sent (B-16). Student has not met the burden ot‘production on this issue,

Failed to allow Student‘s Parents to be equal and/or meaningful participants in the lEP
pr_oc_eis: As indicated above, BOE‘S actions in conducting PPT meetings without making
reasonable efforts to include Student’s Parents signiﬁcantly impeded their opportunity to

paiticipate in the decision—making process regarding the provision of FAPE to Student.

VIII. Should Student be placed at the Options program for the 2010—11 school year, 2011
extended school year, and/or 2011—12 school year at BOE expense?

Student‘s Parents seek compensatory education in the form oftwo years tuition at the
Options program. Student’s Parents requested, and Student’s Private Clinician recommended,
that he attend the Options program for one—on-one tutoring and job placement support. Private
Clinician based her reconnnendation on conversations with Student’s Parents and a ten—minute
conversation with Options Director, She did not Visit the program. Private Clinician testiﬁed that
she was not sure whether the Options program was a classroom setting Private Clinician did not
talk to anyone at BOE about the program and services available to Student. The Options program
provides limited opportunity for peer interaction and socialization.

Private Clinician‘s recommendation appears to be based primarily on whether Student is
too fearful to return to BOE’s schools. The record is not clear on whether the fear or desire not to
attend BOE’s schools is that of Student or Student’s Father.

Student’s last evaluation (2007) recommended that he continue in a mainstream

environment and that he be given opportunities to increase self—esteem and social interactions.

36

February 2, 2012 Final Decision and Order 1 10374

Student has not been recently evaluated to determine whether those recmmncndations and needs
are currently applicable and appropriate. There is insufﬁcient evidence in the record to determine

whether the Options program is appropriate for Student.

IX. Is Student entitled to compensatory education?
As compensatory education is a remedy for certain Violations of the IDEA, whether
Student is entitled to compensatory education is addressed in the F inal Decision and Order below

in response to the issues for which the Hearing Ofﬁcer ﬁnds there to be a violation of IDEA,

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER

1‘ BOB met its burden of proving that it provided Student a free appropriate public education
from March 30, 2009 through the end of the 2008—09 school year,

2‘ BOE met its burden of proving that it provided Student a free appropriate public education

delay in staiting homebound tutoring. This was resolved through the Complaint process at
