   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER    The parties at the telephonic pre-hearing conference held on January 24, 2005 
expressed a desire to resolve their disagreement through a Department-sponsored 
mediation process.  An initial scheduling order was implemented which afforded the 
parties an opportunity to arrange that mediation.  The Parents subsequently reported that 
the parties had reached an agreement resolving their dispute.  The Parents then withdrew 
their request for a hearing in light of that agreement.   
 Accordingly, this matter is 
DISMISSED.
