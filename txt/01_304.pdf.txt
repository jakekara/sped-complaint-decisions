Mangs, Hearing Officer   PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  This hearing was requested on September 11, 2001.  A prehearing conference was convened on September 20, 2001 at which time hearing dates were set for October 9, October 30, October 31, November 2, November 6, and November 7, 2001.  The hearing convened on October 9, 2001 at which time the parties engaged in negotiations.  They informed the hearing officer that they believed they were close to a settlement and requested that they be allowed to continue their negotiations.  It was agreed that they would either notify the hearing officer that they had settled the matter or that they would meet on October 30, 2001 to being taking testimony.  Due to a mistake in scheduling, the hearing did not continue until October 31, 2001 at which time the parties notified the hearing officer that they had indeed, settled, but did not yet have a fully signed agreement.  They requested that the hearing officer cancel the remaining hearing dates and hold the hearing open until they could send an agreement that would become part of the hearing record.  It was agreed that upon receipt of the agreement, the hearing officer would dismiss the case.  On November 7, 2001, the parents sent a fully signed copy of the settlement agreement to the hearing officer.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  This case is dismissed.
