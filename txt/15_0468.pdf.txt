SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Autism and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General
Statute §10—76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the
program offered by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year. The Parents requested placement at Gengras
Center for the 2015-2016 school year. The Board refused the Parents’ request.

On April 23, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The parties agreed to
go to mediation in place of a resolution meeting. The mediation session was held on June 17, 2015. An

agreement had not been executed but requested a withdrawal without prejudice.
