September 7, 2012 and a hearing scheduled for October 18, 2012. On October 9, 2012, Parent’s

granted and a hearing was scheduled for October 30, 2012. On October 23, 2012, the paities jointly
requested an extension of time until October 26, 2012 to exchange exhibits. The request was granted.
The October 30, 2012 hearing date was cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy induced inclement weather
