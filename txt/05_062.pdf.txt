  Appearing before:     Attorney Christine B. Spak    
          Hearing Officer 
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The prehearing conference in this matter was conducted on March 21, 2005.  Both parties 

participated and selected a mutually agreeable date to begin the hearing.  During the 
prehearing the Parent had indicated that she wanted the hearing officer to consider a transcript of testimony from a court proceeding that was related to the instant matter.  
Both parties indicated they would be sending the hearing officer exhibits to review.  The Board forwarded their materials and the Parent did not forward the referred to transcript 

or any other material. The Parent left a voice message asking the hearing officer to call 
her but not giving an explanation.  The call was not returned to avoid the possibility of an ex parte communication. The Board filed a Motion to Dismiss and before a ruling could 
be  issued on this, the Parent advised, again by voice mail, that she wanted to withdraw 
the matter.   
  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The matter is 
DISMISSED.
