Greenwich Board of Education   Appearing on Behalf of the Parent:          Parent Pro Se  Appearing on Behalf of the Board:          Ms. Mary P. Forde             Director of Pupil Personnel Services 
           Greenwich Public Schools 
           290 Greenwich Avenue 
           Greenwich, CT  06830 
 Appearing before:           Attorney Gail K. Mangs, Hearing Officer 
        FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   FINDINGS OF FACT/CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:  This hearing was requested on April 21, 2004.  A prehearing conference was set down for April 26, 2004; the Parent was notified by mail, but the hearing officer did not receive a 
response from him.  The prehearing was postponed until May 6, 2004.  The hearing 
officer eventually learned that the address provided for the parent was incorrect; the 
hearing officer was able to contact the parent by telephone.  During a brief conversation, 
the parent indicated that he was considering whether to hire an attorney and would notify the hearing officer as to his decision in the very near future.  The hearing officer 
informed the Parent that unless he moved forward within a reasonable period of time, the 
hearing would be dismissed.  A letter to this effect was sent to the Parent on May 14, 
2004; the letter also scheduled the prehearing conference for May 21, 2004 at 3:30 p.m.  

Shortly before the scheduled time for the prehearing conference, a woman who identified 
herself as the Parent&#8482;s assistant contacted the hearing officer.  She indicated that the Parent was out of town and would be away until mid-June; she was unable to offer any 
other information.  The prehearing conference went forward as scheduled with Mary 
Forde; the Parent could not be reached.  The hearing officer sent a letter dated May 21, 2004 to the Parent stating that unless the Parent contacted the hearing officer by May 28, 2004, the hearing would be dismissed for failure to go forward with the case.  As of June 
2, 2004, the hearing officer has not received any communication from the Parent.  
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  This hearing is dismissed without prejudice.
