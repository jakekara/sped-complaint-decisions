SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Emotional Disth'bance and is entitled to receive FAPE as
deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C.
§1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement
team (PPT) meeting, the Parents were in disagreement with the program provided by the Board
for the 2014-2015 school year. The Parents requested placement at Logan River Academy. The
Board refused the Parents’ request and ﬁled for due process.

On August 21, 2014, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The
parties agreed to mediate the matter. The mediation date was October 10, 2014. An impartial
hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on August 22, 2014 and a pre-hearing conference was held on
September 8, 2014. A hearing date of October 27, 2014 was chosen by the parties.

 

November 21, 2014 F inal Decision and Order 15-0110

In an electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties
were able to resolve the issues but requested additional time to prepare and ratify the agreement.
On November 18, 2014, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the agreement had
been signed and requested a withdrawal of the matter with prejudice. The date for the mailing of
the Final Decision and Order was extended to November 26, 2014 to accommodate the signing
of the agreement.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescn‘ption of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4—183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
