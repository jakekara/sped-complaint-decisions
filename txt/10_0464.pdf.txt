SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY

cer that, at a resolution session, the parties were able to resolve the matter. The Board informed the hearing officer that the matter was withdrawn with prejudice. At the 

request of the parties, in order to accommodate the filing of a final 
decision and order after the hearing dates, the date for the filing of the Final Decision and Order was extended. The date for the Final decision and order is August 21, 2010. FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:
