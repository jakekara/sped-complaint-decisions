F INAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Was the program provided by the Board for the 2015—2016 school year appropriate and
does it provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the
least restrictive environment (LRE)? If not;

2. Should the Student attend Lindamood—Bell Learning Center for the 2015-2016 school
year in order to receive FAPE in the LRE?

3. Did the Board predetermine the Student’s 2015—2016 school year thereby not allowing
the Parent to be a meaningful participant of the June 4, 2015 PPT?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Speciﬁc Learning Disability and is entitled to receive FAPE
as deﬁned in the IDEA 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10—76a et seq.

At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program offered by
the Board for the 2015—2016 school year. The Parents requested that the Student attend the
Lindamood—Bell Learning Center. The Board refused the Parents’ request. On June 8, 2015, the
Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The parties agreed to go to
mediation in place of a resolution meeting. The mediation session was scheduled for July 16,
2015. An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on June 10, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference
was held on June 26, 2015. The hearing dates chosen by the parties were July 28 and 31, 2015.

In an electronic transmission, the Board’s attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the palties
were able to resolve the issues but the Parents were waiting to receive the ﬁnal draft of the
agreement. On July 21, 2015, the Parent sent an electronic transmission withdrawing the matter.
There was no objection by the Board. The date for mailing the F inal Decision and Order is
August 21, 2015.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the heating ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the

ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance With the provisions of Section 4—183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
