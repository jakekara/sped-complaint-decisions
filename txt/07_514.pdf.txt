  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
   On May 21, 2008, the undersigned hearing 
officer was assigned to hear this matter pursuant to a request for due pro
cess hearing.  The Student was initially represented by his mother, however, on June 4,
 2008, Connecticut Legal Services agreed 
to represent her.  Attorney Catherine 
Cushman was assigned to the case and she 
immediately requested a two w
eek period to request and review the Student&#8482;s records.  The scheduling of the pre-hearing conference was held in abeyance pending Attorney Cushman&#8482;s review.  She met with her client on June 27, 2008, after reviewing the 

Student&#8482;s educational records and indicated th
at she was waiting to receive the Student&#8482;s 
medical records.  

 
 Due to complications the 
review process took longer than expected and on July 11, 2008, the Hearing Officer was informed that
 a plan was in place for the Student to receive a psychiatric consu
ltation regarding his medications.  Attorney Cushman 
informed the Hearing Officer that the mother
 had missed the initial doctor&#8482;s appointment 
and was re-scheduling the same. Attorney 
Cushman indicated that she had difficulties 
contacting the mother.  She also indicated th
at after the consultation was completed she 
was going to meet with the Board&#8482;s repr
esentative, Dr. Pamela Rosenberg, for a 
resolution meeting. 

 
 Since no date certain was provided for 
the re-scheduling of the psychiatric appointment, on July 17,
 1008, the undersigned conferred with the parties and scheduled
