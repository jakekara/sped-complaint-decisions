FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Was the program offered by the Board for the 2016—2017 school year appropriate and did
it provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (F APE) in the least
restrictive environment (LRE)? If so;

2. Should the Board be responsible for the cost of the unilateral placement of the Student at
Chapel Haven ASAT for the 2016—2017 school year?

3. Should the Board be responsible for the cost of an independent educational evaluation?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student is entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive
environment as deﬁned in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA)
20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and
placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parent objected to the program for the 201 6-2107 school
year and unilaterally placed the Student at Chapel Haven ASAT. The Parent requested
reimbursement for the unilateral placement. The Board refused the Parent’s request.

The Board received notice of the request for due process on December 10, 2016. An impartial
hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on December 12, 2016, and a pre—hearing conference was held on
December 23, 2106. The patties attended mediation on J anuary 17, 2017. The Parents’ attorney
advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the matter was resolved and withdrawn with prejudice. The
mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is F ebruary 23, 2017.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the healing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
