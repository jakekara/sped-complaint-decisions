Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   The matter was assigned on August 9, 2004, and a prehearing conference was 
held on August 11.  After the prehearing conference, the Parents&#8482; attorney submitted a 
request for extension of time in accordance with Section 10-76h-9(e) of the Connecticut 
Regulations, which provides for one 30-day postponement for settlement discussions 
between the parties.  This regulation states, in pertinent part, that the hearing officer has no authority to grant any further extensions for continued settlement discussions after the 
first one is granted.    The hearing was scheduled for October 21.  On October 13, the Parents&#8482; attorney submitted a request for an extension of the mailing date of the decision, continuing the 
October 21 hearing to November 4, so that the settlement agreement could be finalized 
and executed.  That request was denied.  On October 14, the Parents&#8482; attorney submitted 

confirmation that the settlement agreement would not be finalized until after the 
scheduled hearing date.  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:  The matter is 
DISMISSED, without prejudice.
