FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

1. Did the District commit procedural Violations of the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act during the 2014-2015 school year, and if so, did such Violations operate to
deny the Student a Free Appropriate Public Education?

2. Was the District’s proposed program for the 2014-2015 school year appropriate, and if
not, what is the appropriate program?

3. Is the District’s proposed program for the 2015—2016 school year appropriate, and, if not,
what is the appropriate program?

PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND SUMMARY:

On May 4, 2015, the Board received a Special Education Due Process Hearing Request ﬁled by
Parents. The undersigned Hearing Ofﬁcer was appointed on May 7, 2015. During the
preheating conference held on May 15, 2015, hearing dates of J uly 6, 2015, July 7, 2015, J uly
17, 2015 and July 20, 2015 were set and the deadline for mailing the Final Decision and Order
was established as July 17, 2015. Parents subsequently ﬁled a separate Special Education Due
Process Request on June 5, 2015 to address an issue pertaining to the coming academic year. A
second preheating conference was held on June 12, 2015 by Hearing Ofﬁcer Ho, who was
assigned to the second Request ﬁled by Parents. After consultation with the undersigned Hearing
Ofﬁcer, the cases were consolidated. As a result of a consolidation of two Special Education Due
Process Hearing Requests the deadline for the ﬁling of the F inal Decision and Order of the
second ﬁled Request was deemed to control and thus, the deadline for the consolidated cases was
established as August 19, 2015. On June 18, 2015, Parents sent a letter to the Hearing Ofﬁcer
indicating the matter had settled and that the Parents were withdrawing both Special Education
Due Process Hearing Requests with prejudice.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

In light of the above facts, the case is dismissed.

 

Ifthe local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school distn‘ct responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after '
receipt thereof, the State Board ofEducation shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal

court by either patty in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415(i)(2)(A).
