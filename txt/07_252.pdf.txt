 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  
ISSUES: 
 
Whether the Board failed to provide the Student with a free appropriate public education 
[FAPE] during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 school years and summer time periods when 

the Student was entitled to FAPE, 
in that the District failed to: 
a. Recognize the need for a referral to special education b. Acknowledge and acted on Student&#8482;s and Parents&#8482; numerous requests for referral to 
special education c. Provide appropriate social skills support and training; d. Consider the Student and Parental input in devising an appropriate educational plan e. Provide an appropriate individualized transition plan to help the student transition to 
life beyond high school. PROCEDURAL HISTORY: 

 
 The Parents filed a reques
t for hearing on June 20, 2007. [Case No. 07-172]  
That case was dismissed by a prior hearing officer on the ba
sis that the Parents di
d not have standing to file a complaint on behalf of a student who is 
18 years old.  The hearing officer also noted that &#64257;[I]n the event that the St
udent files a due process complaint alleging the same matters, 
two additional defects in this complaint are noted,&#64258; that the 
Student had graduated and that the failure to provide a Section 504 plan is not 
within the jurisdiction of the hearing officer. 
[Id.]  
Those notations are dicta; the Student was not a party to the prior action.  
 The Student filed a request 
for hearing, which the District received on August 10, 2007. [Exhibit H.O.-1] A prehearing conference was held on August 21.    
 The District filed a Motion to Dismiss th
e hearing on the basis that the Student had graduated on June 19, 2007 and therefore was not entitled to any special education, that the                                                   1 The District is not identified in this decision, as this decision may include sufficient information to make it 
possible to identify the student.  IDEA Part B regu
lations and the FERPA regulations define personally 
identifiable information to include a list of personal 
characteristics or other information that would make it 
possible to identify the student with reas
onable certainty. 34 C.F.R. 300.32(d)
