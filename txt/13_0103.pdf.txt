This matter is before the Hearing Ofﬁcer pursuant to a Request for Due Process Heating ﬁled by the
Student 0:] August 23, 2012, and received by the Board on the same date. A pre—hearing conference was
held on September 14, 2012, due primarily to difﬁculty in scheduling between the parties. The palties

requested mediation. The issues enumerated above were identiﬁed by the parties. An initial hearing
date of October 16, 2012 was set. A resolution meeting was held 011 September 17, 2012. On October
2, 2012, the Board copied the Hearing Ofﬁcer on an email to the Parent that seemed to indicate that a
resolution agreement was being ﬁnalized. On October 12, 2012, the Hearing Ofﬁcer received an email
from the Parent that she wished to withdraw the request for a due process hearing as a resolution
agreement had been reached; a copy of the Resolution Agreement was subsequently sent to the Hearing
Ofﬁcer by the Board. A request for a more formal withdrawal from the Parent was made by the Hearing
Ofﬁcer, to which the Parent replied that she was attempting to email or fax a formal withdrawal letter
but was not being successful. Based upon the representations made by the Parent in her October 12,
2012 email, as well as a subsequent email dated October 18, with an attached letter dated October 1,
2012 in which the Parent withdrew the complaint, this matter is dismissed with prejudice.

Final Decision and Order:

Pursuant to the request by the Parent to withdraw the request for due process, any pending motions not
yet resolved are dismissed as moot and this matter is dismissed with prejudice.
