Mangs, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUES:  1. Did the Board provide T. with a Free and Appropriate Public Education?  2. Was T. removed from regular education before the appropriate supplementary aids and services were put in place?  3. Is the Board responsible for the cost of Eileen Luddy&#8482;s evaluation?  SUMMARY:  T. is a twelve year old student with Down&#8482;s syndrome.  He has received special education and related services from his local school district since he was three years old.  Although he made satisfactory academic and social progress in elementary school, T.&#8482;s transition to middle school was disastrous.  T. refused to do academic work, ran out of the classroom and through the hallways of the school, was loud and disruptive, and locked himself in the bathroom.  These challenging behaviors intensified until the PPT, unsure of how to deal with T., removed him from regular education and shortened his school day to under 90 minutes.  A behavioral consultant was brought in but when the school district was still unable to control T.&#8482;s behavior, they recommended that T. be placed in either the River St. School or the Gengras Center.  The parents disagreed with the recommendation and requested this hearing.  The prehearing conference was held on March 16, 2001 and the hearing convened on April 2, 4, 6, and 10, 2001.      FINDINGS OF FACT:
