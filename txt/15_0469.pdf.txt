Subsequently, on May 22, 2015 the Student requested a special education due process hearing
claiming related issues against the Board of Education. It was anticipated that the Student’s
case would be consolidated with the Board of Education’s case so that the issues could all be
heard together. In light of this development, the hearing scheduled for May 28, 2015 was
cancelled. On J une 22, 2015, the two cases were consolidated.

request for a thirty-day postponement and extension of the timelines to conduct the hearing
and to ﬁle the ﬁnal decision in this case to July 2, 2015. The Student did not object to the
requested postponement and it was granted. Subsequently, when the two cases were
consolidated, the timeline to conduct the hearing and ﬁle the ﬁnal decision for both cases was
reset to August 5, 2015.
