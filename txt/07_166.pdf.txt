 PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  
 This hearing request by letter to the State De
partment of Education ("SDE") was received 
on June 14, 2007.  The Board of Education received the hearing request on June 15.  This Hearing Officer was assigned to the case on June 15.  On June 19, Atty. Moses appeared for the Board.  On June 20, a notice of a prehearing conference scheduled for June 28 
was faxed to the Board&#8482;s attorney and mailed to the Parent.  All communications with the 

parties were sent in this manner.  On J
une 26, the Parent telephoned the Hearing Officer 
and left a message that he 
was unavailable for the June 28 conference call.  The Hearing 
Officer sent a letter to the parties on June
 27 and asked the Board&#8482;s attorney to contact the Parent by telephone to ascertain whether he was available on June 29 or July 3, the alternate dates given in the June 20 prehearing notice.  The Board&#8482;s attorney wrote to the 
Hearing Officer on June 27 stating that a message was left with the Parent requesting the 

conference to be rescheduled on July 3 at 9:00 a.m.  On June 27, 
the Board&#8482;s attorney filed a Motion to Dismiss and/or Sufficiency 
Challenge to the Parent&#8482;s Complaint.   
 The Hearing Officer rescheduled the prehearing
 conference for July 3 at 8:45 a.m. and 
sent a notice to the parties on June 29, along with a letter advising the Parent that he 

should file a response to the Motion to Dismiss by July 5.  The prehearing conference 
was held on July 3 with the Board&#8482;s attorney.  The Parent did not answer his telephone and the voice mail recording stated that 
a voice mailbox had not been set up.  The 
Board&#8482;s attorney reported that the Parent never returned the telephone call from June 27.  
A hearing date was scheduled for August 2 and the decision deadline was set at August 29, 2007.  On July 3, the Parent faxed a letter to Atty. Moses and the Hearing Officer 
requesting that the &#64257;claim&#64258; be di
smissed without prejudice.  He also stated that:  &#64257;I do not 
know how to respond to such claims.  While my
 claims are genuine, I&#8482;m at a lost.  As it 
happens, I am without legal representation and want closure from Celentano Museum
