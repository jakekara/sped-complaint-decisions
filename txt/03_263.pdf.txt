Hearing Officer  FINAL DECISION AND ORDER ISSUES:  1. Is the program offered by the Board for the 2001-2002, 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 
school years appropriate as required in 20 USC &#167;&#167;1401 et seq?  If not; 
 2. Does the student require a residential program at the Oak Hill School at the Board&#8482;s 
expense? 
 SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY  The student is a nineteen years old young man who has been diagnosed as multi-disabled 
and therefore eligible for special education and related services as defined in 20 USC &#167;&#167;1401 et seq. The parents requested a hearing on or about August 19, 2003. A pre-hearing telephonic conference was scheduled for August 26, 2003 and was rescheduled for September 2, 2003 at which time the parents and the Board agreed to try and mediate 
the matter. A mediation date was set for September 24, 2003, but due to illness the matter 

was continued. A hearing date for October 2, 2003 was scheduled and cancelled in order to allow the parties time to mediate.  The mediation did not go forward due to illness. The 
parent and the Board agreed to a postponement of the matter. The hearing officer set 
December 15, 2003 as hearing date on this matter. On December 9, 2003 the hearing 
officer received a letter from the Board asking that the due process hearing be dismissed 

without prejudice due to the student having a family emergency, which would impede 
their attendance at a hearing.  The date for the final decision and order was January 15, 2004.   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  The matter is 
DISMISSED, without prejudice.
