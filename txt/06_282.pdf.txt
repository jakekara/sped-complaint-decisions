 PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
 This hearing was requested on September 20, 2006 by letter to the State Department of 
Education ("SDE").  The Board received the 
hearing request on the same date.  This 
hearing officer was assigned to the case on September 22.  On October 11, Atty. Brenton 
called the Hearing Officer and stated that she had filed an appearance for the Board the 
previous week.  No written appearance was filed with the Hearing Offi
cer.  A prehearing conference was held on October 13.  The attorneys 
advised the Hearing Officer that they 
wished to waive the resolution meeting and schedule mediation. The decision deadline 

was set at November 29, 2006.  Hearing dates we
re agreed on for November 17 and 30.  
The Parent's attorney was advised to file a 
written request to exte
nd the decision deadline 
for thirty days, which he did on October 19.  The request was granted and the decision deadline was extended to December 29, 2006.  On November 10, the Parent's attorney 

requested a postponement of the November
 17 hearing date because mediation was 

scheduled for November 14 and additional time
 was needed prior to the hearing.  The 
request was granted.  On November 17 the 
SDE advised the Hearing Officer that the 
parties reached an agreement on November 
14 and had withdrawn the hearing request.

 It is ordered that this 
case shall be dismissed.
