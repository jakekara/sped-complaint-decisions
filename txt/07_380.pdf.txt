 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
:  The Student is a  3 year and 8 months 
old child who has been identified as developmentally delayed and is entitled to re
ceive a free and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in Individuals with Disabilities E
ducation Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a.  At a May 29, 2007 PPT, the Parent rejected the program offered by 
the Board for the 2007-2008 school year and requested that the Board pay for the Student&#8482;s therapy sessions.  The Board denied the Parent&#8482;s request and the Parent requested a due process hearing. The Board received 
notice of the request for due process on or about December 10, 2007 and a resolution 
meeting was held by the parties.
