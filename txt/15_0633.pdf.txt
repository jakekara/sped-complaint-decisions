4. Does the program at Deveraux-Glenholme School in Washington, CT provide the Student with FAPE in
the LRE?

5. Is the Student entitled to compensatory education for the denial of FAPE?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has been identiﬁed with Multiple Disabilities and is entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in
IDEA 20 U.S.C. §1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement
team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the program offered by the Board for the 2015-2016 school year
and requested placement of the Student at Deveraux—Glenholme School in Washington, CT at public
expense; the Board denied the Parents’ request. On June 29, 2015, the Board received notice of the Parents’
request for due process. The parties agreed to go to mediation in place of a resolution meeting. The
mediation session was scheduled for August 17, 2015.

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on J une 30, 2015 and a pre-hearing conference was held on J uly
20, 2015. In an electronic transmission, the Parents’ attorney advised the hearing ofﬁcer that the parties were
able to resolve the matter and were withdrawing it with prejudice; there was no objection by the Board. The
date for mailing the F inal Decision and Order is September 11, 2015.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

If the local or regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.

Appeals from the hearing decision of the hearing ofﬁcer may be made to state or federal
court by either party in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-183, Connecticut
General Statutes, and Title 20, United States Code 1415 (i)(2)(A).
