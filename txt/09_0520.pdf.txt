 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
  This matter was commenced by request for due 
process dated June 12, 2009 (the &#64257;Request&#64258;).  The undersigned was appointed as Hearing Officer on June 22, 2009.  By agreement of the parties a 
telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) convened on July 1, 2009.  
The Hearing Officer determined that, absent 
modification, the date for mailing of the Final 
Decision and Order (&#64257;FD&O&#64258;) 
would have been August 28, 2009.2  The parties at the PHC advised both that they would attempt to resolve their disput
e through a Connecticut Department of Education 
(&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;)-facilitated mediation schedul
ed for July 17, 2009 and that they anticipated at least 8 days of hearing would be required to present their respective cases.  Six poten
tial hearing dates were identified 
(August 20, 21 and 31, 2009 and September 1, 3 and 
10, 2009) which reflected the timing of the 
CTDOE-facilitated mediation and th
e desire of the parties not to be burdened with preparing simultaneously for mediation and a hearing.  Given th
ese circumstances, and as more fully explained in 
the July 2, 2009 Order, the date for mailing of th
e FD&O was extended to and including October 2, 
2009.  The Board on June 25, 2009 filed an &#64257;initial response&#64258; to the Request, noting among other things 
its intention to assert a jurisdictional challenge regard
ing some of the claims in the Request and to file a 
sufficiency challenge.  The Parents on June 29, 2009 filed a letter responding to the Board&#8482;s initial                                                  1 The Student and Parents had initially been represented in this matter by Anne Eason, Esq.  On July 27, 2009, the 
Parents advised the Hearing Officer that they were no longe
r represented by Attorney Eason and were proceeding on a 
pro se
 basis.  2 As explained more fully in the July 2, 2009 Initial Scheduling and Related Orders (the &#64257;July 2 Order&#64258;), the parties 
disagreed as to whether the Dist
rict received the due process request on June 12, 
2009 (it was faxed to th
e District at 4:47 pm
 after the District&#8482;s offices had closed for the day) or June 15, 2009 (a Monday, and the next Business Day on which the 
District offices were open)
.  If the due process request was received on June
 12, 2009 (a Friday), absent modification by the 
Hearing Officer, the date for the mailing of the Final Decision and Order would be August 25, 2009 (a Tuesday).  If the due 
process request was received on June 15
, 2009 (a Monday), absent modification by
 the Hearing Officer, the date for the 
mailing of the Final Decision and Order would be August 28, 2009 (a Friday).   To the extent a determination on that issue 

was required, the Hearing Officer concluded 
in the July 2 Order that the District r
eceived the due process request on July 15, 
2009, and that absent modification the date for mailing of the Final Decision and Order would be August 28, 2009.
