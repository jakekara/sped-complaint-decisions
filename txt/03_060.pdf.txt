 Appearing before:     Attorney Margaret J. Slez, Hearing Officer 
 FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  1. Did the parents breach the settlement agreement by failing to place the student in the 
Board preschool program for the 2002-2003 school year?  
2. Did the Board offer the student an appropriate program for the 2002-2003 school year? 
3. Is the Foundation School an appropriate placement for the student? 
4. Are the parents entitled to reimbursement for the costs of the student&#8482;s placement at the 
Foundation School? 
 SUMMARY:  The student, now 5 years old, has been diagnosed with pervasive development disorder/NOS 
with autistic characteristics.  At the end of the 2001-2002 school year, the parents objected to the program proposed by the Board for the 2002-2003 school year and requested placement of the 
student at the Foundation School. The Board denied the request and the parents then requested due process hearing on July 25, 2002 (Exhibit B-71).  On October 2, 2002, the parties entered into a settlement agreement (Exhibit B-70).  The parents contend, however, that the Board failed 
to offer an appropriate program notwithstanding the parties&#8482; agreement.  The Board contends 

that the parents&#8482; refusal to bring the student to the Board preschool program prevented 
implementation of a program and, in doing so, the parents breached the parties&#8482; agreement.  At a 
PPT meeting on December 17, 2002, the parties failed to resolve the issues regarding an 

appropriate program for the student.  In January 2003, the parents unilaterally placed the student 
at the Foundation School.  On February 26, 2003, the parents requested due process hearing, seeking reimbursement for the cost of the student&#8482;s placement at the Foundation School.
