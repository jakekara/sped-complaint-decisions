ISSUES:

1. Does the Student require special education and related services as deﬁned in the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA)? If so;

2. Was the program provided by the Board for the 2014—2015 school year appropriate and does it
provide the Student with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive
environment (LRE)?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

The Student has not been identiﬁed as entitled to receive FAPE as deﬁned in the Individuals With
Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. {$1401 et seq. and Connecticut General
Statute §10-76a et seq. At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents rejected the
ﬁnding that the Student was not eligible to receive special education and 1'e1ated services. The Parents
requested that the Student be identiﬁed as eligible to receive special education and related services. The
Board denied the Parents’ request. The Parents ﬁled for due process.

On October 29, 2014, the Board received notice of the Parents’ request for due process. The parties
agreed to forego a resolution meeting and mediate the matter. The mediation date was December 10,
2014. An impaltia1hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on October 29, 2014 and a pre—hearing conference
was held on November 4, 2014. A hearing date of J anuary 7, 2015 was chosen by the parties. At the
J antu 7, 2015, hearing date the parties ratiﬁed an agreement and the matter was withdrawn with
prejudice.

The date for mailing the Final Decision and Order was extended in order to accommodate the mediation
and hearing date. The mailing date for the Final Decision and Order is February 11, 2015.
