Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION   This proceeding was commenced on September 23, 2004 by the Student&#8482;s mother 
to challenge a determination regarding the Student&#8482;s special education program at a 
September 17, 2004 Planning & Placement Team meeting.  The Student is 14.5 years old.  
By agreement of the parties, the Student was represented at all points in this hearing 
process by his maternal grandmother (the &#64257;Grandmother&#64258;).  A telephonic pre-hearing 
conference was convened on October 5, 2004.  The grandmother and counsel for the 

Board participated.  Both parties expressed an interest in attempting to resolve their 
dispute through mediation.  A procedural order was entered, establishing a November 2, 
2004 second pre-hearing conference and November 5, 2004 hearing date should the 
mediation be unsuccessful.  The November 8, 2004 date for issuance of a final decision 
and order was not changed.  On November 1, 2004, the Hearing Officer was advised that 

the parties had resolved their dispute through mediation and that this request for hearing 
was being withdrawn.  This matter is dismissed.
