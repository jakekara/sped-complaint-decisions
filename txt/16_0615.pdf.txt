FINAL DECISION AND ORDER
ISSUES:

Was the Student’s conduct, according to 34 CPR. §300.534, not a manifestation of his
disability as decided by the Board at the May 5, 2016 meeting?

SUMMARY AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

At the time of the manifestation determination, the Student was not identiﬁed as entitled to

General Statute §10-76a et seq.

At a planning and placement team (PPT) meeting, the Parents disagreed with the determination
that the Student’s conduct was not a manifestation of his disability and stated that the Student’s
conduct was a manifestation of his disability according to 34 C.F.R. §300.5 34; the Board

An impartial hearing ofﬁcer was appointed on June 20, 2016 and a pre-hearing conference was
held on June 27, 2016. Hearing dates of J u1y 13 and 14, 2016 were chosen by the parties. In an
electronic transmission dated June 29, 2016, the Parents’ attomey informed the hearing ofﬁcer
that the matter had been resolved and withdrew the matter with prejudice. The date for the
mailing the Final Decision and Order is August 4, 2016.

FINAL DECISION AND ORDER:

THE MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

 

If the local 01' regional board of education or the uniﬁed school district responsible for
providing special education for the student requiring special education does not take
action on the ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer within ﬁfteen days after
receipt thereof, the State Board of Education shall take appropriate action to enforce the
ﬁndings or prescription of the hearing ofﬁcer.
