75 Broad Street 
Milford, CT 06460 Appearing Before: 
  Attorney Scott P. 
Myers, M.A. (Clinical Psychology), J.D.      Hearing Officer 
FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
The Parent objects to the District&#8482;s recommendation made at
 the March 24, 2009 IEP team meeting that the Student be placed out-of-distric
t at ACES Mill Road for the 2009/20210 school year.  
For the reasons set forth below, that recommendati
on is reasonably calculated to provide the Student 
with a free appropriate education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) in the least restric
tive environment (&#64257;LRE&#64258;).  Over the 
course of the 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 school years, the Student manifested episodes of aggressive 
behavior toward staff, other students and/or the physical environmen
t of the mainstream schools he was 
attending. These episodes of aggressi
ve behavior are associated with features of his disability (autism), 
which include social skill and problem solving deficits and have become increasingly unpredictable.  
Interventions put into place &#338; including a behavioral intervention plan and a dedicated, 1:1 adult 

paraprofessional to support him throughout his entir
e school day &#338; have not been successful at addressing the Student&#8482;s behavioral issues, which interfere with his ability to access fully his 
educational program and present a threat to the safe
ty of staff, peers and the Student.  The ACES Mill 
Road program is fully equipped to address both th
e academic, social and behavioral challenges the 
Student is experiencing. ISSUE SET FOR HEARING Whether the District&#8482;s recommendation that the 
Student be placed at ACES Mill Road for the 
2009/2010 school year was reasonably calculated to provide him with a FAPE in the (&#64257;LRE&#64258;). 
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND A. Summary/Overview This matter was commenced by request for due pr
ocess (the &#64257;Request&#64258;) filed by the Student&#8482;s 
mother (the &#64257;Parent&#64258; or &#64257;Mothe
r&#64258;) received by the State of Connecticut Department of Education 
(&#64257;CTDOE&#64258;) on April 28, 2009. The Request challenge
s the District&#8482;s recommendation at the March 24, 2009 IEP team meeting that the Student be placed 
out-of-district at ACES Mill Road.  The Request 
states that the District is making that recommendati
on &#64257;due to some behaviors [the Student] had in class
