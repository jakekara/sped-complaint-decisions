A prehearing conference was scheduled on May 10. The Board administrator, Ms. Boyd, was not available.  This hearing officer was referred to Atty. DeGraffenreidt's office, but she was not available at that time.  The prehearing conference proceeded with the student and his counselor.  At that time the Student was living at a halfway house in another city and requested tutoring from New Haven, his home city.  A hearing date was scheduled for June 11, 2002.  On May 17, the Board's attorney called the hearing officer and reported that the case was resolved.  On June 5, the Hearing Officer wrote to the parties and asked if a hearing would be necessary.  If not the Student was asked to file a withdrawal.  If a hearing was needed, the June 11 hearing would have to be rescheduled.  Later that day the Director of the half-way house faxed a memorandum stating that the Student had been discharged on May 28 and provided his home address in New Haven.  The Board's attorney telephoned and reported that her office had prepared a withdrawal for the Student's signature and that he and his mother were expected to come to her office and sign it.  The deadline for the mailing of the final decision was June 17.  No communication has been received from the parties in the last 30 days.
