Parent’s Attorney ﬁled notice of her appearance on December 18, 2012. Later in the same day,
the Board’s Attorney provided notice of her appearance. After consideration of the coming
winter school vacation, on December 18, 2012, the Hearing Ofﬁcer offered several dates for the
hearing to the Parties; given the season, she included the possibility of late afternoon or evening
in addition to the usual daytime schedule for hearings.

On December 27, 2012, Parent’s Attorney informed the Hearing Ofﬁcer that the Parties had
agreed to waive a re501ution meeting and to request mediation. She also reported that the
Student would be unilaterally placed by Parent aﬂer the winter vacation and that “as far as the
Parent is concerned, this placement removes the urgency for an expedited hearing. , .”.

After further emails concerning the status 01‘ the case, Parent’s Attorney confirmed that the
Parties had requested mediation and withdrew the request for hearing on January 1 1, 20131

All motions and objections not previously ruled upon, ii‘any, are hereby overruled.
