Campane Sullivan, Schoen, Campane & Connon  646 Prospect Avenue Hartford CT 06105-4286  Appearing before:  Attorney Margaret J. Slez, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER  ISSUES:  1. Did the Board offer the student an appropriate program for the 2001-2002 school year?  2. Are the parents entitled to reimbursement for their unilateral placement of the student at Ben Bronz Academy?  SUMMARY:  In April 1998, in the second grade, the student was found eligible for special education services based on the identification of a specific learning disability.  At the end of third grade, the 1998-99 school year, the parents agreed to retaining the student in the third grade for the 1999-2000 school year (Exhibit B-19).  Over the course of the student&#8482;s fourth grade year, school year 2000-2001, the parents became increasingly dissatisfied with the student&#8482;s progress.  On June 28, 2001, the parents gave written notice to the Board (Exhibit B-71) that they were rejecting the IEP (Exhibit B-68) developed for the 2001-2002 school year, proposed at IEP meetings on June 7 and 19, 2001, and requested that the student be placed at Ben Bronz Academy for fifth grade.  Upon the Board&#8482;s refusal to place the student at Ben Bronz Academy, the parents requested a due process hearing by letter dated September 12, 2001 (Exhibit H.O.-1).
