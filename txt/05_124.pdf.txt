July 8, 2005 - 1 - Final Decision and Order 05-124 STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION   Student v. Hartford Board of Education       Appearing for the Student: Christina D. Ghio, Esq. Center for Children&#8482;s Advocacy University of Connecticut School of Law 65 Elizabeth Street Hartford, CT  06105  Appearing for the Board: Ann F. Bird, Esq. Assistant Corporation Counsel City of Hartford 550 Main Street, Room 210 Hartford, CT  06103  Appearing Before:  Scott Myers, J.D., M.A. (Clinical Psychology)     Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER    The Mother commenced this action on behalf of her son (the &#64257;Student&#64258;).  In her May 10, 2005 request for due process, the Mother alleged that the Board had failed to provide the Student with a FAPE over a three academic year period and sought relief in the form of summer and after school programming to address social/emotional and academic deficits.  She also sought annual evaluations by independent experts in mental health, language/reading acquisition and written expression to develop appropriate after school and summer programming for the Student.  A telephonic pre-hearing conference (&#64257;PHC&#64258;) was convened on June 2, 2005.   The parties advised that they desired to resolve their dispute through settlement and had scheduled a mediation for June 6, 2005 for this purpose.  To permit the parties an opportunity to resolve their disagreement through mediation, an initial scheduling order was entered which contemplated a July 7, 2005 hearing date should the efforts of the parties to resolve their dispute amicably prove unsuccessful.  On June 20, 2005, the parties reported that they had essentially resolved their disagreement but had not yet finalized a written settlement agreement.  The parties requested an extension of the due dates for submission of their records and witness lists, as provided in the June 4, 2005 initial scheduling order.  That request was granted, but the July 7, 2005 hearing date and July 11, 2005 date for the issuance of the Final Decision and Order were not extended.  By July 5, 2005, the parties reported that they had finalized their settlement and that the settlement, among other things, provided that this matter may be dismissed without prejudice to refiling.   Accordingly, the July 7, 2005 hearing date is cancelled and this matter is dismissed without prejudice to refiling.
