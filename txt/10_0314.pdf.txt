SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
: The student is 14 years and 11 months old who  
has been identified with Autism and is entitled 
to receive a free and appropriate public education 
(&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. 
&#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. At a PPT meeting, the Parent 
requested that the Board provide Robotics as a related service. The Board denied the Parent&#8482;s request and the Parent requested due process. On or about February 5, 2010, the Board received notice of the Parent&#8482;s request for due process. A resolution meeting was scheduled 
for February 22, 2010 and mediation was held on 
March 10, 2010. An impartial hearing officer wa
s appointed on February 8, 2010 and a pre-hearing conference was held on February 16, 2010. . Hearing dates of April 5, 8, 12, and 14, 2010 were chosen by the parties. On about February 15, 2010 the Board filed a suff
iciency challenge to the Parent&#8482;s request for due process. At the prehearing conference the cha
llenge was discussed and granted and the Parent was instructed to resubmit the request for due pr
ocess by the agreed date of February 19, 2010. The Parent filed a timely revised due process complaint.
