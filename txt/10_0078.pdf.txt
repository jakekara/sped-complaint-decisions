FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
A special education hearing in the above-captione
d matter was requested by the Student via letter 
dated September 2, 2009. It was received by the Board of Education on the same date. Therefore, the 30-day 
resolution period ran through October 2, 2009.  The original
 deadline for mailing the final decision and order 
was November 16, 2009. 
A pre-hearing conference was held on October 13, 2009. Attorney Mascolo appeared on behalf of the Student and Attorney Moses appeared on behalf of the Board of Education. After a discussion about the original request for hearing and changes in facts subsequent to the filing of the request, the following issues were identified: 
1.Whether the Board of Education&#8482;s 2009 speech
 and language evaluation is appropriate; 
2.If the Board of Education&#8482;s 2009 speech and language evaluation is not appropriate, is the Student entitled to an independent evaluation at public expense? The parties participated in mediation on Octobe
r 9, 2009. The matter was not 
resolved at mediation 
but the parties continued their discussions. On October 28, 2009, the Board of Education filed a request for a 30-day postponement pursuant to 
Connecticut State Regulations Sec
tion 10-76h-9(e) and an extension of the mailing date pursuant to 
Connecticut State Regulations Section 10-76h-9(d). The Student joined in the requests. The request for a 30-day postponement and extension of the mailing date was granted after full consideration of the positions of 
the parties. The deadline for mailing the final d
ecision and order was extended until December 16, 2009. 
The matter was scheduled for hearing on December 1, 2009.
