DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
Student v. Middletown Board of Education Appearing on Behalf of the Parent: Pro Se Appearing on Behalf of the Board: Attorney Christine Chinni 
Chinni & Meuser, LLC 30 Avon Meadow Lane 
Avon, CT 06001 Appearing Before: 
  Attorney Justino Rosado, Hearing Officer ISSUES: 1. Was the Student improperly exited as a student
 requiring services from the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973 Section 504? FINAL DECISION AND ORDER 
SUMMARY and PROCEDURAL HISTORY
: The Student has not been identified as entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education (&#64257;FAPE&#64258;) as defined in IDEA 20 U.S.C. &#167;1401 et seq. and Connecticut General Statute &#167;10-76a. The Parent objected to the Student being exited from hi
s Section 504 program and asked that he
 be reinstated. The Board refused the Parent&#8482;s request. An impartia
l hearing officer was appointed on October 7, 2010 and a pre-hearing conference was held on October 26, 2010 but communication with the Pare
nt was abruptly terminated.  
Another pre-hearing conferences was attempted, on 
or about November 16, 2010. The conference was not 
able to be completed as communication with the Parent was again lost. The hearing officer attempted to 

recall the Parent but was informed 
that the Parent was no longer present. Before the conference ended, 
hearing dates of December 10 and 15, 2010 were set by th
e parties. (Hearing Officer&#8482;s Exhibit # 4). On or about November 22, 2010, a resolution meeting was held by 
the parties. In an email from the Parent, the 
hearing officer was informed that the matter had been resolved. 
The date for mailing of the Final 
Decision and Order is December 24, 2010. FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: 

THE MATTER IS DISMI
SSED WITH PREJUDICE. 
COMMENT. A Motion to Dismiss should have been file
d by the Board on this matter as it was a strict a 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Section 504 action and not a matter under the ju
risdiction of an Individual with Disabilities Education Improvement 
Act hearing officer. If the matter w
ould have continued to hearing, the hearing officer would have had to dismiss it. This would only have frustrated the Parent and caused the 

Parent more pain.
