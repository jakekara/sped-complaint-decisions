October 23, 2002 -1- Final Decision and Order 02-288   STATE OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION   Student v. Putnam Board of Education  Appearing on behalf of the Parents:  Attorney Andrew Feinstein       Law Offices of David C. Shaw       34 Jerome Avenue &#338; Suite 210       Bloomfield, CT  06002  Appearing on behalf of the Board:  Attorney Frederick L. Dorsey       Siegel, O&#8482;Connor, Schiff & Zangari       150 Trumbull Street       Hartford, CT  06103  Appearing before:    Attorney Gail K. Mangs, Hearing Officer    ISSUES:  1. Does a hearing officer have jurisdiction to award monetary damages under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983?  SUMMARY AND FINDINGS OF FACT:  1. This hearing was requested on September 25, 2002.  The request for hearing states in part, &#64257;This letter is to request, on behalf of L.&#8482;s family, a due process hearing solely for the purposes of seeking monetary damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1983 for the unconscionable violation of their civil rights by the Putnam Board of Education in June 2002.  While we are aware that a Connecticut administrative hearing officer is without power to order a local education agency to pay monetary damages to an injured student, we are also aware of court decisions stating that we must exhaust our administrative remedies prior to bring an action in federal court for the recovery of monetary damages.&#64258; The hearing request made reference to Polera v. Board of Education of Newburgh Enlarged City School District, 238 F. 3d 478 (2d Cir. 2002).  The request for hearing then continued by outlining L.&#8482;s history of behavioral difficulties which resulted in hospitalization and diagnosis of bipolar disorder, the Board&#8482;s eventual designation of L. as a student eligible for special education services, and a description of events leading to L.&#8482;s arrest.  (Exhibit H.O. 1)  2. A prehearing conference was held on September 27, 2002.  During the prehearing conference, the parties agreed that the hearing would be convened on October 15,
