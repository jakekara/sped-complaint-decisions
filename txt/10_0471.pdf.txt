PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
The Parents&#8482; attorney faxed a letter on June 4, 2010 to the Board&#8482;s Di
rector of Pupil Personnel Services requesting a due process hearing. A c
opy was sent on that date to the State Department of Education.  Another 
hearing officer was assigned to the case on June 9, 2010.  On June 14, 2010, the Parents&#8482; filed a Motion to Consolidate requesting that this case be consolidated with a case filed by the Board against the Parents, which 
was assigned to this Hearing Office
r.  The Board objected to consolidating that case with the other hearing 
officer because of the emergency nature of the Board&#8482;s 
due process request.  On June 17, 2010, after conferring 
with the other hearing officer, she referred this case to this Heari
ng Officer.  The Parents&#8482; Motion to Consolidate was granted. A prehearing conference was 
held on July 2, 2010.  One hearing date was agreed on for July 21, 2010. The mailing date for the final decision was set at August 18, 2010.   
On July 12, 2010, the Parents&#8482; attorney advised the Hearing Officer that the parties had settled both cases at a resolution session on July 7, 2010 and that the Parents were withdrawing this hearing request.
