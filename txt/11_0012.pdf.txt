ISSUE: Did the Board fail to respond in a timely manner 
to the Parent&#8482;s request for an independent educational evaluation in violation of 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.502(a)(2) of the IDEA regulations? 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
The Parents (Mother) requested th
is hearing by mailing a hearing re
quest form dated July 2, 2010 
to the State Department of Educatio
n and the Board.  The Board received
 a copy of the request on July 6, 2010. This Hearing Officer was assi
gned to the case on July 9, 2010.  A prehearing conference was held on July 21, 2010 with the Mother, her advocate and the Board&#8482;s Director of Special Services.  The Board&#8482;s representative stated that the Bo
ard had filed a due process request to defend its evaluation on July 1, 2010, which was assigned to another hearing officer. One 
issue was identified for hearing in this case.  A hearing date was scheduled for August 25, 2010 and the mailing date for the fi
nal decision was set at September 20, 2010.  The Parent sent a 
letter following the prehearing conference outlining the issue with greater detail, along with copies of documents pe
rtaining to the Board&#8482;s due process request.   On August 11, 2010, the Parent&#8482;s advocate e-mailed a lett
er to the Hearing Officer stating that as a result of mediation earlier that da
y, both parties agreed to withdraw their hearing requests.  On August 17, 2010, the Hearing Officer received a letter from the Parent stating that she wished to withdraw her due process hearing request. FINAL DECISION AND ORDER: 
It is ordered that this 
case shall be dismissed.
