Mangs, Hearing Officer   FINAL DECISION AND ORDER   ISSUES:    Has the Board offered an appropriate program for S. for the 2002-2003 school year; specifically, does ACES&#8482; elimination of a 4.5 hour Saturday educational program require that the school district provide those 4.5 hours of educational programming in some other way?  PROCEDURAL HISTORY:  This hearing was requested on May 29, 2002.  The prehearing conference was convened on June 5, 2002.  The hearing convened on June 25, 2002.  The parent called Fred Senechal of the Department of Mental Retardation as her witness.  The Board of Education called Susan L. Viccaro, Director of Pupil Personnel Services for Region 13 as their witness.  The hearing officer called S.&#8482;s mother as a witness.  The record was closed on June 25, 2002.  SUMMARY:    S. is a twelve year old student who has been identified as having multiple disabilities.  She has been placed at ACES [Area Cooperative Educational Services, the regional educational service center serving south central Connecticut] Village School by the Board since the 1998-1999 school year.  During the second half of that school year, ACES requested that S. begin attending their Saturday morning program so that S.&#8482;s family could attend a signing class.  During the 1998-1999 school year, the program was held on most Saturday mornings.  During the 1999-2000 school year, the Saturday class met approximately 28 times.  The program was reduced by ACES to 20 Saturdays per 10 month school year for all participating students for the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school
